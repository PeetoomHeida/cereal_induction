  abstract	= {Co-infections – invasions of a host-plant by multiple
		  pathogen species or strains – are common, and are thought
		  to have consequences for pathogen ecology and evolution.
		  Despite their apparent significance, co-infections have
		  received limited attention; in part due to lack of suitable
		  quantitative tools for monitoring of co-infecting
		  pathogens. Here, we report on a duplex real-time {PCR}
		  assay that simultaneously distinguishes and quantifies
		  co-infections by two globally important fungal pathogens of
		  wheat: Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Parastagonospora
		  nodorum. These fungi share common characteristics and host
		  species, creating a challenge for conventional disease
		  diagnosis and subsequent management strategies. The assay
		  uses uniquely assigned fluorogenic probes to quantify
		  fungal biomass as nucleic acid equivalents. The probes
		  provide highly specific target quantification with accurate
		  discrimination against non-target closely related fungal
		  species and host genes. Quantification of the fungal
		  targets is linear over a wide range (5000–0.5 pg {DNA}
		  μl-1) with high reproducibility ({RSD} ≤ 10\%). In the
		  presence of host {DNA} in the assay matrix, fungal biomass
		  can be quantified up to a fungal to wheat {DNA} ratio of 1
		  to 200. The utility of the method was demonstrated using
		  field samples of a cultivar sensitive to both pathogens.
		  While visual and culture diagnosis suggested the presence
		  of only one of the pathogen species, the assay revealed not
		  only presence of both co-infecting pathogens (hence
		  enabling asymptomatic detection) but also allowed
		  quantification of relative abundances of the pathogens as a
		  function of disease severity. Thus, the assay provides for
		  accurate diagnosis; it is suitable for high-throughput
		  screening of co-infections in epidemiological studies, and
		  for exploring pathogen–pathogen interactions and
		  dynamics, none of which would be possible with conventional
		  approaches.},

		  all plants. Previous herbivory affected {FAW} larval weight

		  reduced weight gain of larvae fed on Si accumulator plants.
		  Notably, our results strongly suggest that non-glandular
		  trichomes are important reservoirs of Si in maize and may
		  increase plant resistance to chewing herbivores. We
		  conclude that Si offers transient resistance to {FAW} in

  shorttitle	= {The role of savannas in the terrestrial Si cycle},
  abstract	= {Savannas currently occupy a fifth of the earth's land
		  surface and are predicted to expand in the next few
		  centuries at the expense of tropical forests, mainly as a
		  result of deforestation and human fires. Can such a
		  vegetation trend impact, through changes in plant Si
		  cycling, the lithogenic silicon ({LSi}) release into soils
		  (through chemical weathering) and the net dissolved Si
		  ({DSi}) outputs from soils to stream water (through
		  chemical denudation)? The first step of an investigation
		  requires quantifying the net Si fluxes involved in the
		  plant/soil system. Here, a schematic steady-state Si cycle,
		  established for a tropical humid savanna (Lamto, Ivory
		  Coast) that developed on a ferruginous soil and is
		  subjected to annual fires, is presented. Erosion was
		  assumed to be insignificant. {LSi} and biogenic Si ({BSi}
		  under the form of phytoliths) pools were measured, and Si
		  fluxes were estimated from Si concentrations and mass
		  balance calculation. Identification of plant and soil
		  phytoliths indicated that the soil {BSi} pool is in
		  equilibrium with the current {BSi} input by the savanna. In
		  the soil column, mixing between a young rapidly recycled
		  {BSi} pool and an old stable {BSi} pool is attested by a
		  mixing line equation. Storage of the old {BSi} pool is
		  assimilated as a {BSi} output from the plant/soil system. A
		  {BSi} output additionally occurs after annual fires, when
		  ashes are exported. Both {BSi} outputs decrease as much the
		  {BSi} dissolution. In order to uptake constant {DSi} flux,
		  the savanna increases by three to eight times the net {LSi}
		  release, depending upon the post-fire ash exportation
		  scenario. A comparison between savanna and rainforest Si
		  cycles that maximizes the differences in plant/soil systems
		  and minimizes differences in climate is presented. The
		  comparison revealed that {BSi} storage is higher in the
		  savanna soil than in the rainforest soil, mainly due to
		  {BSi} production that is twice higher in the savanna (127
		  vs 67kg/ha/yr). The resulting {LSi} release that is
		  enhanced by plant uptake is more than 1.5 higher in the
		  savanna than in the rainforest (from 33 to 85kg/ha/yr in
		  the savanna vs 21kg/ha/yr in the rainforest). On the
		  contrary, {DSi} output from soils to stream water, which is
		  not controlled by plant Si cycling but more likely by the
		  soil hydrological regime (or meteoric weathering), is close
		  to twice as high in the rainforest/ferrallitic soil
		  ecosystem (16 vs 9kg/ha/yr). This case study suggests that
		  the predicted expansion of savannas at the expense of
		  forests should significantly increase {DSi} uptake by
		  plants, {BSi} storage in soils, {BSi} output with ash
		  exportation, and, hence, {LSi} release through chemical
		  weathering, without direct impact on {DSi} outputs from
		  soils to stream water. Tracks for further assessing the
		  role of plant Si cycling on chemical weathering, Si and C
		  cycles were suggested: 1) estimates of {BSi} fluxes that
		  were wrongly based on the assumption that the amount of
		  {DSi} leached out from soils is linked to the magnitude of
		  plant Si cycling and/or to {BSi} concentration in soils
		  should be reappraised and 2) changes in the magnitude of
		  plant Si cycling should be accounted in geochemical carbon
		  cycle models, for one of the plant-induced weathering
		  mechanisms.},

  abstract	= {1. Although secondary metabolites are recognized as
		  fundamental to the defence of plants against insect and
		  mammalian herbivores, their relative importance compared to
		  other potential defensive plant traits (e.g. physical
		  resistance, gross morphology, life-history, primary
		  chemistry and physiology) are not well understood. 2. We
		  conducted a meta-analysis to answer the question: What
		  types of genetically variable plant traits most strongly
		  predict resistance against herbivores? We performed a
		  comprehensive literature search and obtained 499 separate
		  measurements of the strength of covariation (measured as
		  genetic correlations) between plant traits and herbivore
		  susceptibility – these were extracted from 72 studies
		  involving 19 plant families. 3. Surprisingly, we found no
		  overall association between the concentrations of secondary
		  metabolites and herbivore susceptibility – plant traits
		  other than secondary metabolites most strongly predicted
		  herbivore susceptibility. Specifically, genetic variation
		  in life-history traits (e.g. flowering time, growth rate)
		  consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations
		  with susceptibility. Genetic variation in gross
		  morphological traits (e.g. no. branches, plant size) and
		  physical resistance traits (e.g. latex, trichomes) were
		  also frequently correlated with variation in herbivore
		  susceptibility, but these relationships depended on
		  attributes of the herbivores (e.g. feeding guild) and
		  plants (e.g. longevity). 4. These results call into
		  question the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolites
		  are the most important anti-herbivore defence of plants. We
		  propose the hypothesis that herbivores select most strongly
		  on genetic variation in life-history, morphological and
		  physical resistance traits, but the greater pleiotropic
		  effects of genes controlling these traits impose strong
		  constraints on their evolution. Meanwhile, secondary
		  metabolites could have evolved to be important defensive
		  mechanisms not because they have the largest effect on
		  herbivores, but because the constraints on their evolution
		  are the weakest.},

		  which alleviates a range of stresses including defence
		  against herbivores. Likewise, grasses symbiotically
		  associate with foliar Epichloë-fungal endophytes which
		  provide herbivore defence, mainly via the production of
		  alkaloids. Some Epichloë-endophytes increase foliar Si
		  concentrations, particularly in tall fescue (Festuca
		  arundinacea) but also in perennial ryegrass (Lolium
		  perenne); it is unknown whether this impacts herbivores.
		  Likewise, while Si is primarily a physical defence against
		  herbivores, it can also affect defensive secondary
		  metabolites; Si supply might therefore also affect
		  alkaloids produced by Epichloë-endophytes, however, this
		  remains untested. We grew tall fescue and perennial
		  ryegrass in a factorial combination with or without Si
		  supplementation, in the absence or presence of a chewing
		  herbivore; Helicoverpa armigera. Grasses were associated
		  with four different Epichloë-endophyte strains (tall
		  fescue: {AR}584; perennial ryegrass: {AR}37, {AR}1, or wild
		  type) or as Epichloë-free controls. Specifically, we
		  assessed how Si supply and Epichloë-endophyte presence
		  impacts plant growth and chemistry, and how their
		  interaction with herbivory affects foliar Si concentrations
		  and alkaloid production. Subsequently, their effects on H.
		  armigera relative growth rates ({RGR}) were evaluated. In
		  Fescue, the {AR}584-endophyte increased constitutive
		  (herbivore-free) and induced (herbivore-inoculated) silicon
		  concentrations when Si was supplied. In perennial ryegrass,
		  {AR}37-endophyte increased constitutive and induced silicon
		  concentration, meanwhile, {AR}1-endophyte increased
		  constitutive levels only. Si supply and herbivory did not
		  affect alkaloids produced by {AR}584- or {AR}1/Wt-endophyte
		  in tall fescue and perennial ryegrass, respectively.
		  However, Si suppressed herbivore-induced production of
		  alkaloids in the {AR}37-endophyte perennial ryegrass
		  association. Si was a more effective defence in tall fescue
		  than perennial ryegrass, significantly reducing H. armigera
		  {RGR}. Our results suggest that Si reduced herbivore
		  performance to such an extent in tall fescue that it was
		  operating at maximum effect and endophyte-mediated
		  increases in Si concentration made no further difference.
		  Si had a more modest impact on herbivores in perennial
		  ryegrass, potentially linked to silicon decreasing
		  herbivore feeding and thus, suppressing herbivore-induced
		  alkaloids. We provide novel evidence that increased Si
		  concentrations in some cases interact with
		  endophyte-produced chemical defences, which could
		  ultimately impact plant resistance to herbivores.},

		  numerous reports have shown its beneficial effects in a
		  variety of species and environmental circumstances. This
		  has created much confusion in the scientific community with
		  respect to its biological roles. Here, we link molecular
		  and phenotypic data to better classify Si transport, and
		  critically summarize the current state of understanding of
		  the roles of Si in higher plants. We argue that much of the
		  empirical evidence, in particular that derived from recent
		  functional genomics, is at odds with many of the
		  mechanistic assertions surrounding Si's role. In essence,
		  these data do not support reports that Si affects a wide
		  range of molecular-genetic, biochemical and physiological
		  processes. A major reinterpretation of Si's role is
		  therefore needed, which is critical to guide future studies
		  and inform agricultural practice. We propose a working
		  model, which we term the ‘apoplastic obstruction
		  hypothesis’, which attempts to unify the various
		  observations on Si's beneficial influences on plant growth
		  and yield. This model argues for a fundamental role of Si
		  as an extracellular prophylactic agent against biotic and
		  abiotic stresses (as opposed to an active cellular agent),

		  high root or shoot Si concentration are less prone to pest

		  However, the most remarkable effect of Si is the reduction

		  are caused by biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, and necrotrophic

		  fungi are ubiquitous symbionts of most terrestrial plants.
		  These fungi not only provide their host plants with access
		  to nutrients and resources but are known to augment plant
		  defences against insect herbivores. Relatively little is
		  known about the role of {AM} fungal diversity and community
		  assembly on the expression of plant defence traits. Here,
		  we report how plant (\textit{Triticum aestivum})
		  phenolic-based resistance to insect herbivory is
		  differentially affected by different {AM} fungal
		  communities. An inoculant of four {AM} fungal species and a
		  field-sourced native {AM} fungal community increased plant
		  phenolics by 47.9\% and 50.2\%, respectively, compared to
		  plants inoculated with only one fungal species.
		  Correspondingly, the performance (relative growth rate) of
		  the insect herbivore was 36\% and 61.3\% lower when feeding
		  on plants associated with these {AM} fungal communities.
		  Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between
		  foliar phenolics and herbivore growth. We propose that {AM}
		  fungal community assembly can drive insect herbivore
		  performance by affecting phenolic-based defence

		  can alter both constitutive and induced phytohormone

		  ppm) {CO}2 concentrations, we tested how plant growth,
		  foliar Si concentration and endogenous {JA} responded to
		  methyl jasmonate ({MeJA}) application and the subsequent
		  effects on insect herbivore performance (Helicoverpa

		  significantly increased Si concentration in Si+ plants. Si+
		  plants had higher baseline {JA} levels compared to Si−

		  Collectively our results suggest that Si alters the {JA}

		  abiotic and biotic stress is now widely recognised and
		  researched. Amongst the biotic stresses, Si is known to
		  increase resistance to herbivores through biomechanical and
		  chemical mechanisms, although the latter are indirect and
		  remain poorly characterised. Chemical defences are
		  principally regulated by several antiherbivore
		  phytohormones. The jasmonic acid ({JA}) signalling pathway
		  is particularly important and has been linked to Si
		  supplementation, albeit with some contradictory findings.
		  In this Perspectives article, we summarise existing
		  knowledge of how Si affects {JA} in the context of
		  herbivory and present a conceptual model for the
		  interactions between Si and {JA} signalling in wounded
		  plants. Further, we use novel information from the model
		  grass Brachypodium distachyon to underpin aspects of this
		  model. We show that Si reduces {JA} concentrations in
		  plants subjected to chemical induction (methyl jasmonate)
		  and herbivory (Helicoverpa armigera) by 34\% and 32\%,
		  respectively. Moreover, +Si plants had 13\% more leaf
		  macrohairs than −Si plants. From this study and previous
		  work, our model proposes that Si acts as a physical
		  stimulus in the plant, which causes a small, transient
		  increase in {JA}. When +Si plants are subsequently attacked
		  by herbivores, they potentially show a faster induction of
		  {JA} due to this priming. +Si plants that have already
		  invested in biomechanical defences (e.g. macrohairs),
		  however, have less utility for {JA}-induced defences and
		  show lower levels of {JA} induction overall.},

  abstract	= {Silicon as a defence against herbivory in grasses has
		  gained increasing recognition and has now been studied in a
		  wide range of species, at scales from individual plants in
		  pots to plant communities in the field. The impacts of
		  these defences have been assessed on herbivores ranging
		  from insects to rodents to ungulates. Here, we review
		  current knowledge of silicon mediation of plant–herbivore
		  interactions in an ecological context. The production of
		  silicon defences by grasses is affected by both abiotic and
		  biotic factors and by their interactions. Climate, soil
		  type and water availability all influence levels of silicon
		  uptake, as does plant phenology and previous herbivory. The
		  type of defoliation matters and artificial clipping does
		  not appear to have the same impact on silicon defence
		  induction as herbivory which includes the presence of
		  saliva. Induction of silicon defences has been demonstrated
		  to require a threshold level of damage, both in the
		  laboratory and in the field. In recent studies of
		  vole–plant interactions, the patterns of induction were
		  found to be quantitatively similar in glasshouse compared
		  with field experiments, in terms of both the threshold
		  required for induction and timing of the induction
		  response. The impacts of silicon defences differ between
		  different classes of herbivore, possibly reflecting
		  differences in body size, feeding behaviour and digestive
		  physiology. General patterns are hard to discern however,
		  and a greater number of studies on wild mammalian
		  herbivores are required to elucidate these, particularly
		  with an inclusion of major groups for which there are
		  currently no data, one such example being marsupials. We
		  highlight new research areas to address what still remains
		  unclear about the role of silicon as a plant defence,
		  particularly in relation to plant–herbivore interactions
		  in the field, where the effects of grazing on defence
		  induction are harder to measure. We discuss the obstacles
		  inherent in scaling up laboratory work to landscape-scale
		  studies, the most ecologically relevant but most difficult
		  to carry out, which is the next challenge in silicon

		  soil properties. It has been shown that such legacies can
		  affect future plants that grow in the same soil
		  (plant–soil feedback, {PSF}). Such processes have been
		  studied in detail, but mostly on individual plants. Here,
		  we study {PSF} effects at the community level and use a
		  trait-based approach both in the conditioning phase and in
		  the feedback phase to study how 12 individual soil legacies
		  influence six plant communities that differ in root size.
		  We tested if (1) grassland perennial species with large
		  root systems would leave a stronger legacy than those with
		  small root systems, (2) grass species would leave a more
		  positive soil legacy than forbs, and (3) communities with
		  large root systems would be more responsive than
		  small-rooted communities. We also tested (4) whether a
		  leaf-chewing herbivore and a phloem feeder were affected by
		  soil legacy effects in a community framework. Our study
		  shows that the six different plant communities that we used
		  respond differently to soil legacies of 12 different plant
		  species and their functional groups. Species with large
		  root systems did not leave stronger legacies than species
		  with small root systems, nor were communities with large
		  root systems more responsive than communities with root
		  systems. Moreover, we show that when communities are
		  affected by soil legacies, these effects carry over to the
		  chewing herbivore Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera:
		  Noctuidae) through induced behavioural changes resulting in
		  better performance of a chewing herbivore on
		  forb-conditioned soils than on grass-conditioned soils,
		  whereas performance of the phloem feeder Rhopalosiphum padi
		  (Hemiptera: Aphididae) remained unaffected. Synthesis. The
		  results of this study shed light on the variability of soil
		  effects found in previous work on feedbacks in communities.
		  Our study suggests that the composition of plant
		  communities determines to a large part the response to soil
		  legacies. Furthermore, the responses to soil legacies of
		  herbivores feeding on the plant communities that we
		  observed, suggests that in natural ecosystems, the
		  vegetation history may also have an influence on

  abstract	= {Abstract Silicon (Si) accumulation alleviates a diverse
		  array of environmental stresses in many plants, including
		  conferring physical resistance against insect herbivores.
		  It has been hypothesised that grasses, in particular,
		  utilise ?low metabolic cost? Si for structural and
		  defensive roles under nutrient limitation. While carbon (C)
		  concentrations often negatively correlate with Si
		  concentrations, the relationship between nitrogen (N)
		  status and Si is more variable. Moreover, the impacts of N
		  limitation on constitutive physical Si defences (e.g.
		  silica and prickle cells) against herbivores are unknown.
		  We determined how N limitation affected Si deposition in
		  the model grass Brachypodium distachyon and how changes in
		  these constitutive defences impacted insect herbivore
		  Helicoverpa armigera growth rates. We used scanning
		  electron microscopy ({SEM}) and energy dispersive X-ray
		  spectrometry in conjunction with X-ray mapping ({XRM}) to
		  quantify physical structures on leaves and determine Si
		  deposition patterns. We also determined how N limitation
		  and Si supply impacted the jasmonic acid ({JA}) pathway,
		  the master regulator of induced defences against arthropod
		  herbivores. N limitation reduced shoot growth by over 40\%,
		  but increased root mass (+21\%), leaf Si concentrations
		  (+50\%) and the density of silica (+28\%) and flattened
		  prickle (+76\%) cells. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
		  and {XRM} established that Si was being deposited in these
		  structures, together with hooked prickle cells and
		  macro-hairs. Herbivore relative growth rates ({RGR}) were
		  more than 115\% lower in Si-supplied plants compared to
		  plants without Si supply and negatively correlated with
		  leaf Si concentration and silica cell density. {RGR} was
		  further reduced by N limitation and positively correlated
		  with leaf N concentrations. Increases in {JA}
		  concentrations following induction of the {JA} pathway were
		  at least doubled by N limitation. Synthesis. Si
		  accumulation and deposition were highly regulated by N
		  availability, with N limitation promoting both constitutive
		  Si physical defences and induction of the {JA} defensive
		  pathway, in line with the resource availability hypothesis.
		  These results indicate that grasses use ?low-cost Si? when
		  resources are limited and suggest that plant productivity
		  may benefit from optimising conventional fertilisers and Si

		  also have the capacity to take up large amounts of silicon
		  (Si), which accumulates in plant tissues. Si accumulation
		  has antiherbivore properties, but it is poorly understood
		  how Si defenses relate to defense hormone signaling. Here
		  we show that Si enrichment causes the model grass
		  Brachypodium distachyon to show lower levels of {JA}
		  induction when attacked by chewing herbivores. Triggering
		  this hormone even at lower concentrations, however, prompts
		  Si uptake and physical defenses (e.g., leaf hairs), which

		  restored performance. Crucially, activation of such
		  Si-based defense is herbivore-specific and occurred only in
		  response to chewing and not fluid-feeding (aphid)
		  herbivores. This aligned with our meta-analysis of 88
		  studies that showed Si defenses were more effective against

		  may act as an antiherbivore defence by increasing the
		  abrasiveness and reducing the digestibility of grass
		  leaves, although there is little direct experimental
		  evidence to support this. 2 We investigated the effects of
		  manipulated silica levels on the abrasiveness of the leaves
		  of five grass species. We also examined the effects of
		  silica levels on the feeding preferences, growth
		  performance and digestion efficiency of two folivorous
		  insects and one phloem-feeding insect. 3 Silica addition
		  resulted in increases to leaf abrasiveness in four of the
		  five grass species studied. Silica addition also deterred
		  feeding by both folivores and reduced their growth rates
		  and digestion efficiency. 4 These effects resulted in lower
		  pupal mass of the lepidopteron larvae Spodoptera exempta
		  and compensatory feeding by the orthopteran, Schistocerca
		  gregaria. In contrast, silica had no effects on the feeding
		  preference or the population growth of the phloem feeder,
		  Sitobion avenae. 5 Our results demonstrate that silica is
		  an effective defence against folivorous insects, both as a
		  feeding deterrent, possibly mediated by increased
		  abrasiveness, and as a digestibility reducer. The effects
		  of silica on pupal mass and development time may impact on
		  herbivore fitness and exposure to natural enemies. 6 These

  abstract	= {To date, the functional role of plant silicon has mostly
		  been investigated in grasses (Poaceae). This potentially
		  overlooks the importance of silicon in other plant
		  functional groups such as legumes (Fabaceae). Legumes form
		  a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria
		  (rhizobia) inside the root nodules for fixing atmospheric
		  nitrogen. A small, but growing number of studies suggest
		  that silicon promotes this symbiotic relationship. We
		  consider how legumes may take up and deposit silicon
		  relative to what is known about these processes in grasses.
		  We synthesize information about how silicon affects legume
		  growth and function in the context of environmental
		  stresses and the legume–rhizobia symbiosis. The available
		  literature indicates that silicon is broadly beneficial to
		  legumes, alleviating the effects of stresses including
		  metal toxicity, salinity, alkalinity and pathogens.
		  Crucially, there is also evidence that silicon promotes the
		  legume–rhizobia interaction including increased root
		  nodulation, numbers of bacteroids and nitrogen fixation
		  across several legume species. We propose a model for how
		  silicon may benefit the legume–rhizobia interaction. We
		  hypothesize that silicification in the tissues may reduce
		  the high metabolic cost of carbon-based compounds in cell
		  wall construction, optimize solute transport and gas
		  exchange in root nodules and/or promote protection against
		  environmental stresses. We therefore propose a hypothetical
		  framework to better understanding the impacts of silicon on
		  legume–rhizobia relationships. We also suggest potential
		  research priorities that would help us to better understand
		  the functional role of silicon in nitrogen-fixing legumes.
		  These research priorities focus on characterizing how
		  silicon affects the chemical dialogues between the host
		  plant and its rhizobial partner, how silicon is deposited
		  in legume roots and how resources are exchanged by the two.
		  Given the growing importance of legumes at a global scale,
		  silicon could play a vital role in improving legume health
		  and productivity with manifold environmental benefits. A

		  Plant biosilica particles (phytoliths) contain small
		  amounts of carbon called {phytC}. Based on the assumptions
		  that {phytC} is of photosynthetic origin and a closed
		  system, claims were recently made that phytoliths from
		  several agriculturally important monocotyledonous species
		  play a significant role in atmospheric {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$
		  sequestration. However, anomalous {phytC} radiocarbon
		  ($^{\textrm{14}}$C) dates suggested contributions from a
		  non-photosynthetic source to {phytC}. Here we address this
		  non-photosynthetic source hypothesis using comparative
		  isotopic measurements ($^{\textrm{14}}$C and
		  \textit{δ}$^{\textrm{13}}$C) of {phytC}, plant tissues,
		  atmospheric {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$, and soil organic matter.
		  State-of-the-art methods assured phytolith purity, while
		  sequential stepwise-combustion revealed complex
		  chemical-thermal decomposability properties of {phytC}.
		  Although photosynthesis is the main source of carbon in
		  plant tissue, it was found that {phytC} is partially
		  derived from soil carbon that can be several thousand years
		  old. The fact that {phytC} is not uniquely constituted of
		  photosynthetic C limits the usefulness of {phytC} either as
		  a dating tool or as a significant sink of atmospheric
		  {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$. It additionally calls for further
		  experiments to investigate how {SOM}-derived C is
		  accessible to roots and accumulates in plant biosilica, for
		  a better understanding of the mechanistic processes
		  underlying the silicon biomineralization process in higher
		  plants.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract	= {A recurring theme in defense allocation theories is that
		  defenses are costly. Most studies that attempt to quantify
		  a cost of defense seek to establish a trade-off between a
		  component of plant fitness and the level of a constitutive
		  defense. Such estimates are ambiguous because they cannot
		  discount the cost of traits that are correlated with
		  defense but are not themselves defensive. We examined the
		  effects of damage-induced synthesis of furanocoumarins,
		  known defense compounds, on the growth of wild parsnip.
		  Plants that had 2\% of their leaf area removed accumulated
		  8.6\% less total biomass and 14\% less root biomass than
		  intact plants over a 4-week period. We also found that this
		  small amount of leaf damage significantly reduced net
		  photosynthetic rates 0.5 h after damage; the effect was
		  temporary, as photosynthetic rates were no longer
		  significantly different after 48 h. Lastly, we found that
		  increases in respiration rates associated with damage
		  coincided spatially and temporally with increases in
		  furanocoumarin production, and that respiration increases
		  were phenotypically correlated with furanocoumarin
		  production. When damage-induced changes in furanocoumarin
		  content and respiration rates were expressed in glucose
		  equivalents and compared, the energetic cost of
		  furanocoumarin production (12.6 μg glucose cm−2)
		  accounted for all of the increase in respiration (12.0 μg
		  glucose cm−2). A comparison of other secondary compounds
		  in damaged and intact leaflets revealed that myristicin, a
		  furanocoumarin synergist, is the only other compound aside
		  from furanocoumarins that is inducible. The inducible
		  defense system of wild parsnip thus appears to involve a
		  small subset of secondary compounds. Synthesis of these
		  compounds is tightly linked to damage-induced rates of
		  respiration. Because the negative impact that damage had on
		  the rate of net photosynthesis was short-lived, the impact
		  of damage on growth observed in this study was likely due
		  to the cost of furanocoumarin synthesis elicited by damage
		  rather than the loss of photosynthetic tissue caused by
		  damage.},
