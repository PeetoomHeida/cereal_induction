  abstract	= {Given that a plant's defensive strategy against herbivory
		  is never likely to be a single trait, we develop the
		  concept of plant defense syndromes, where association with
		  specific ecological interactions can result in convergence
		  on suites of covarying defensive traits. Defense syndromes
		  can be studied within communities of diverse plant species
		  as well as within clades of closely related species. In
		  either case, theory predicts that plant defense traits can
		  consistently covary across species, due to shared
		  evolutionary ancestry or due to adaptive convergence. We
		  examined potential defense syndromes in 24 species of
		  milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) in a field experiment. Employing
		  phylogenetically independent contrasts, we found few
		  correlations between seven defensive traits, no bivariate
		  trade-offs, and notable positive correlations between
		  trichome density and latex production, and between C:N
		  ratio and leaf toughness. We then used a hierarchical
		  cluster analysis to produce a phenogram of defense trait
		  similarity among the 24 species. This analysis revealed
		  three distinct clusters of species. The defense syndromes
		  of these species clusters are associated with either low
		  nutritional quality or a balance of higher nutritional
		  quality coupled with physical or chemical defenses. The
		  phenogram based on defense traits was not congruent,
		  however, with a molecular phylogeny of the group,
		  suggesting convergence on defense syndromes. Finally, we
		  examined the performance of monarch butterfly caterpillars
		  on the 24 milkweed species in the field; monarch growth and
		  survival did not differ on plants in the three syndromes,
		  although multiple regression revealed that leaf trichomes
		  and toughness significantly reduced caterpillar growth. The
		  discovery of convergent plant defense syndromes can be used
		  as a framework to ask questions about how abiotic
		  environments, communities of herbivores, and biogeography
		  are associated with particular defense strategies of
		  plants.},

  abstract	= {Savannas currently occupy a fifth of the earth's land
		  surface and are predicted to expand in the next few
		  centuries at the expense of tropical forests, mainly as a
		  result of deforestation and human fires. Can such a
		  vegetation trend impact, through changes in plant Si
		  cycling, the lithogenic silicon ({LSi}) release into soils
		  (through chemical weathering) and the net dissolved Si
		  ({DSi}) outputs from soils to stream water (through
		  chemical denudation)? The first step of an investigation
		  requires quantifying the net Si fluxes involved in the
		  plant/soil system. Here, a schematic steady-state Si cycle,
		  established for a tropical humid savanna (Lamto, Ivory
		  Coast) that developed on a ferruginous soil and is
		  subjected to annual fires, is presented. Erosion was
		  assumed to be insignificant. {LSi} and biogenic Si ({BSi}
		  under the form of phytoliths) pools were measured, and Si
		  fluxes were estimated from Si concentrations and mass
		  balance calculation. Identification of plant and soil
		  phytoliths indicated that the soil {BSi} pool is in
		  equilibrium with the current {BSi} input by the savanna. In
		  the soil column, mixing between a young rapidly recycled
		  {BSi} pool and an old stable {BSi} pool is attested by a
		  mixing line equation. Storage of the old {BSi} pool is
		  assimilated as a {BSi} output from the plant/soil system. A
		  {BSi} output additionally occurs after annual fires, when
		  ashes are exported. Both {BSi} outputs decrease as much the

		  scenario. A comparison between savanna and rainforest Si

  abstract	= {Savannas currently occupy a fifth of the earth's land
		  surface and are predicted to expand in the next few
		  centuries at the expense of tropical forests, mainly as a
		  result of deforestation and human fires. Can such a
		  vegetation trend impact, through changes in plant Si
		  cycling, the lithogenic silicon ({LSi}) release into soils
		  (through chemical weathering) and the net dissolved Si
		  ({DSi}) outputs from soils to stream water (through
		  chemical denudation)? The first step of an investigation
		  requires quantifying the net Si fluxes involved in the
		  plant/soil system. Here, a schematic steady-state Si cycle,
		  established for a tropical humid savanna (Lamto, Ivory
		  Coast) that developed on a ferruginous soil and is
		  subjected to annual fires, is presented. Erosion was
		  assumed to be insignificant. {LSi} and biogenic Si ({BSi}
		  under the form of phytoliths) pools were measured, and Si
		  fluxes were estimated from Si concentrations and mass
		  balance calculation. Identification of plant and soil
		  phytoliths indicated that the soil {BSi} pool is in
		  equilibrium with the current {BSi} input by the savanna. In
		  the soil column, mixing between a young rapidly recycled
		  {BSi} pool and an old stable {BSi} pool is attested by a
		  mixing line equation. Storage of the old {BSi} pool is
		  assimilated as a {BSi} output from the plant/soil system. A
		  {BSi} output additionally occurs after annual fires, when
		  ashes are exported. Both {BSi} outputs decrease as much the
		  {BSi} dissolution. In order to uptake constant {DSi} flux,
		  the savanna increases by three to eight times the net {LSi}
		  release, depending upon the post-fire ash exportation
		  scenario. A comparison between savanna and rainforest Si

  abstract	= {The importance of herbivore–plant and soil biota–plant
		  interactions in terrestrial ecosystems is amply recognized,
		  but the effects of aboveground herbivores on soil biota
		  remain challenging to predict. To find global patterns in
		  belowground responses to vertebrate herbivores, we
		  performed a meta-analysis of studies that had measured
		  abundance or activity of soil organisms inside and outside
		  field exclosures (areas that excluded herbivores).
		  Responses were often controlled by climate, ecosystem type,
		  and dominant herbivore identity. Soil microfauna and
		  especially root-feeding nematodes were negatively affected
		  by herbivores in subarctic sites. In arid ecosystems,
		  herbivore presence tended to reduce microbial biomass and
		  nitrogen mineralization. Herbivores decreased soil
		  respiration in subarctic ecosystems and increased it in
		  temperate ecosystems, but had no net effect on microbial
		  biomass or nitrogen mineralization in those ecosystems.
		  Responses of soil fauna, microbial biomass, and nitrogen
		  mineralization shifted from neutral to negative with
		  increasing herbivore body size. Responses of animal
		  decomposers tended to switch from negative to positive with
		  increasing precipitation, but also differed among taxa, for
		  instance Oribatida responded negatively to herbivores,
		  whereas Collembola did not. Our findings imply that losses
		  and gains of aboveground herbivores will interact with
		  climate and land use changes, inducing functional shifts in
		  soil communities. To conceptualize the mechanisms behind
		  our findings and link them with previous theoretical
		  frameworks, we propose two complementary approaches to
		  predict soil biological responses to vertebrate herbivores,
		  one focused on an herbivore body size gradient, and the
		  other on a climate severity gradient. Major research gaps
		  were revealed, with tropical biomes, protists, and soil
		  macrofauna being especially overlooked.},

  shorttitle	= {Linking above-ground and below-ground interactions},
  abstract	= {Studies of the effects of above-ground herbivory on soil
		  organisms and decomposer food webs, as well as the
		  processes that they regulate, have largely concentrated on
		  the effects of non-living inputs into the soil, such as
		  dung, urine, body parts and litter. However, there is an
		  increasing body of information which points to the
		  importance of plant physiological responses to herbivory in
		  regulating soil organisms and therefore, implicitly, key
		  soil processes such as decomposition and nutrient
		  mineralisation. In this review we identify the mechanisms
		  by which foliar herbivory may indirectly affect the soil
		  biota and associated below-ground processes through
		  affecting plants, so as to better understand the nature of
		  interactions which exist between above-ground and
		  below-ground biota. We consider two broad pathways by which
		  above-ground foliar herbivory may affect soil biotic
		  communities. The first of these occurs through herbivore
		  effects on patterns of root exudation and carbon
		  allocation. These effects manifest themselves either as
		  short-term changes in plant C allocation and root exudation
		  or as long-term changes in root biomass and morphology.
		  Evidence suggests that these mechanisms positively
		  influence the size and activity of the soil biotic
		  community and may alter the supply of nutrients in the
		  rhizosphere for plant uptake and regrowth. The second of
		  these involves herbivores influencing soil organisms
		  through altering the quality of input of plant litter.
		  Possible mechanisms by which this occurs are through
		  herbivory enhancing nitrogen contents of root litter,
		  through herbivory affecting production of secondary
		  metabolites and concentrations of nutrients in foliage and
		  thus in leaf litter and through selective foliar feeding
		  causing shifts in plant community structure and thus the
		  nature of litter input to the soil. While the effects of
		  herbivory on soil organisms via plant responses may be
		  extremely important, the directions of these effects are
		  often unpredictable because several mechanisms are often
		  involved and because of the inherently complex nature of
		  soil food-web interactions; this creates obvious
		  difficulties in developing general principles about how
		  herbivory affects soil food-webs. Finally, it is apparent
		  that very little is understood on how responses of soil
		  organisms to herbivory affect those ecosystem-level
		  processes regulated by the soil food-web (e.g.
		  decomposition, nutrient mineralisation) and that such
		  information is essential in developing a balanced
		  understanding about how herbivory affects ecosystem
		  function.},

		  Summary Plant–soil feedback ({PSF}) occurs when plants
		  alter soil properties that influence the performance of
		  seedlings, with consequent effects on plant populations and
		  communities. Many processes influence {PSF}, including
		  changes in nutrient availability and the accumulation of
		  natural enemies, mutualists or secondary chemicals.
		  Typically, these mechanisms are investigated in isolation,
		  yet no single mechanism is likely to be completely
		  responsible for {PSF} as these processes can interact.
		  Further, the outcome depends on which resources are
		  limiting and the other plants and soil biota in the
		  surrounding environment. As such, understanding the
		  mechanisms of {PSF} and their role within plant communities
		  requires quantification of the interactions among the
		  processes influencing {PSF} and the associated abiotic and
		  biotic contexts.},

		  other potential defensive plant traits (e.g. physical
		  resistance, gross morphology, life-history, primary
		  chemistry and physiology) are not well understood. 2. We
		  conducted a meta-analysis to answer the question: What
		  types of genetically variable plant traits most strongly
		  predict resistance against herbivores? We performed a
		  comprehensive literature search and obtained 499 separate
		  measurements of the strength of covariation (measured as
		  genetic correlations) between plant traits and herbivore
		  susceptibility – these were extracted from 72 studies
		  involving 19 plant families. 3. Surprisingly, we found no
		  overall association between the concentrations of secondary
		  metabolites and herbivore susceptibility – plant traits
		  other than secondary metabolites most strongly predicted
		  herbivore susceptibility. Specifically, genetic variation
		  in life-history traits (e.g. flowering time, growth rate)
		  consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations
		  with susceptibility. Genetic variation in gross
		  morphological traits (e.g. no. branches, plant size) and
		  physical resistance traits (e.g. latex, trichomes) were
		  also frequently correlated with variation in herbivore
		  susceptibility, but these relationships depended on
		  attributes of the herbivores (e.g. feeding guild) and
		  plants (e.g. longevity). 4. These results call into
		  question the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolites
		  are the most important anti-herbivore defence of plants. We
		  propose the hypothesis that herbivores select most strongly
		  on genetic variation in life-history, morphological and
		  physical resistance traits, but the greater pleiotropic
		  effects of genes controlling these traits impose strong
		  constraints on their evolution. Meanwhile, secondary
		  metabolites could have evolved to be important defensive
		  mechanisms not because they have the largest effect on
		  herbivores, but because the constraints on their evolution

		  practices. There is increasing evidence that crop
		  domestication can profoundly alter interactions among
		  plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies. Overall,
		  little is known about how these interactions are affected
		  by domestication in the geographical ranges where these
		  crops originate, where they are sympatric with the
		  ancestral plant and share the associated arthropod
		  community. In general, domestication consistently has
		  reduced chemical resistance against herbivorous insects,
		  improving herbivore and natural enemy performance on crop
		  plants. More studies are needed to understand how changes

		  abiotic constraints including water stress and soil
		  nutrient deficiencies. It is imperative to develop
		  drought-tolerant wheat varieties with high yield potential
		  and enhanced grain protein content for food security.
		  Silicon (Si) is important for plant growth and development
		  but its role in abiotic stress tolerance has been
		  overlooked in breeding programs. Identifying the underlying
		  functional genes controlling drought tolerance, protein
		  content and grain yield is essential for wheat improvement,
		  especially under drought stress. Silicon uptake is
		  conditioned by several Si transporter genes such as Lsi1,
		  Lsi2 and Lsi6 and aquaporins, which facilitate transport of
		  silicon and water between cells. The objectives of this
		  review are to examine the role of Si in improving plant
		  nutrition and drought tolerance, and to appraise the
		  genetic control of Si uptake and breeding methods for
		  improving Si uptake for drought adaptation and improved
		  grain yield and quality. The review highlights the limited
		  progress made in breeding for drought tolerance in wheat,
		  especially in sub-Sahara Africa where the challenge is
		  prevalent. Limited understanding of the genetic basis for
		  Si uptake and physiology contribute to the limited progress
		  in its exploitation in wheat improvement programs.},

  abstract	= {Hundreds of single species studies have demonstrated the
		  facility of silicon (Si) to alleviate diverse abiotic
		  stresses in plants. Understanding of the mechanisms of
		  Si-mediated stress alleviation is progressing, and several
		  reviews have brought information together. A quantitative
		  assessment of the alleviative capacity of Si, however,
		  which could elucidate plant Si function more broadly, was
		  lacking. We combined the results of 145 experiments,
		  predominantly on agricultural species, in a meta-analysis
		  to statistically assess the responses of stressed plants to
		  Si supply across multiple plant families and abiotic
		  stresses. We interrogated our database to determine whether
		  stressed plants increased in dry mass and net assimilation
		  rate, oxidative stress markers were reduced, antioxidant
		  responses were increased and whether element uptake showed
		  consistent changes when supplied with Si. We demonstrated
		  that across plant families and stress types, Si increases
		  dry weight, assimilation rate and chlorophyll biosynthesis
		  and alleviates oxidative damage in stressed plants. In
		  general, results indicated that plant family (as a proxy
		  for accumulator type) and stress type had significant
		  explanatory power for variation in responses. The
		  consistent reduction in oxidative damage was not mirrored
		  by consistent increases in antioxidant production,
		  indicative of the several different stress alleviation
		  mechanisms in which Si is involved. Silicon addition
		  increased K in shoots, decreased As and Cd in roots and Na
		  and Cd in shoots. Silicon addition did not affect Al, Ca or
		  Mn concentration in shoots and roots of stressed plants.
		  Plants had significantly lower concentrations of Si
		  accumulated in shoots but not in roots when stressed.
		  Meta-analyses showed consistent alleviation by Si of
		  oxidative damage caused by a range of abiotic stresses
		  across diverse species. Our findings indicate that Si is
		  likely to be a useful fertilizer for many crops facing a
		  spectrum of abiotic stresses. Similarities in responses
		  across families provide strong support for a role of Si in
		  the alleviation of abiotic stress in natural systems, where
		  it has barely been explored. We suggest this role may
		  become more important under a changing climate and more
		  experiments using non-agricultural species are now
		  needed.},

  abstract	= {Over millions of years, terrestrial plants have competed
		  for limited resources, defended themselves against
		  herbivores, and resisted a myriad of environmental
		  stresses. These struggles have helped generate more than a
		  quarter million terrestrial plant species, each possessing
		  a unique strategy for success. Yet, as Resource Strategies
		  of Wild Plants demonstrates, the constraints on plant
		  growth are universal enough that a few survival strategies
		  hold true for all seed-producing plants. This book
		  describes the five major strategies of growth for
		  terrestrial plants, details how plants succeed when
		  resources are scarce, delves into the history of research
		  into plant strategies, and resets the foundational
		  understanding of ecological processes. Drawing from recent
		  findings in plant-herbivore interactions, ecosystem
		  ecology, and evolutionary ecology, Joseph Craine explains
		  how plants attain available nutrients, withstand the
		  immense stresses of drying soils, and flourish in the race
		  for light. He shows that the competition for resources has
		  shaped plant evolution in newly discovered ways, while the
		  scarcity of such resources has affected how plants interact
		  with herbivores, wind, fire, and frost. An understanding of
		  the major resource strategies of wild plants remains
		  central to learning about the ecology of plant communities,
		  global changes in the biosphere, methods for species
		  conservation, and the evolution of life on earth.},

		  matter to several percent, and in some plants to 10\% or
		  even higher. In spite of this prominence of silicon as a
		  mineral constituent of plants, it is not counted among the
		  elements defined as "essential," or nutrients, for any
		  terrestrial higher plants except members of the
		  Equisitaceae. For that reason it is not included in the
		  formulation of any of the commonly used nutrient solutions.
		  The plant physiologist's solution-cultured plants are thus
		  anomalous, containing only what silicon is derived as a
		  contaminant of their environment. Ample evidence is
		  presented that silicon, when readily available to plants,
		  plays a large role in their growth, mineral nutrition,
		  mechanical strength, and resistance to fungal diseases,
		  herbivory, and adverse chemical conditions of the medium.
		  Plants grown in conventional nutrient solutions are thus to
		  an extent experimental artifacts. Omission of silicon from
		  solution cultures may lead to distorted results in
		  experiments on inorganic plant nutrition, growth and
		  development, and responses to environmental stress.},

		  phytoliths in soil solutions, we determined the solubility,
		  surface properties (electrophoretic mobilities and surface
		  charge) and dissolution kinetics of phytoliths extracted
		  from fresh biomass of representative plant species (larch
		  tree and elm, horsetail, fern, and four grasses) containing
		  significant amount of biogenic silica. The solubility
		  product of larch, horsetail, elm and fern phytoliths is
		  close to that of amorphous silica and soil bamboo
		  phytoliths. Electrophoretic measurements yield isoelectric
		  point {pHIEP}=0.9, 1.1, 2.0 and 2.2 for four grasses, elm,
		  larch and horsetail phytoliths respectively, which is very
		  close to that of quartz or amorphous silica. Surface
		  acid–base titrations allowed generation of a 2-{pK}
		  surface complexation model ({SCM}) for larch, elm and
		  horsetail phytoliths. Phytoliths dissolution rates,
		  measured in mixed-flow reactors at far from equilibrium
		  conditions at 1≤{pH}≤8, were found to be very similar
		  among the species, and close to those of soil bamboo
		  phytoliths. Mechanistic treatment of all plant phytoliths
		  dissolution rates provided three-parameters equation
		  sufficient to describe phytoliths reactivity in aqueous
		  solutions:R(mol/cm2/s)=6⋅10−16⋅{aH}++5.0⋅10−18+3.5⋅10−13⋅{aOH}−0.33
		  Alternatively, the dissolution rate dependence on {pH} can
		  be modeled within the concept of surface coordination
		  theory assuming the rate proportional to concentration of
		  {\textgreater}{SiOH}2+, {\textgreater}{SiOH}0 and
		  {\textgreater}{SiO}− species. In the range of Al
		  concentration from 20 to 5000 ppm in the phytoliths, we
		  have not observed any correlation between their Al content
		  and solubility, surface acid–base properties and
		  dissolution kinetics. It follows from the results of this
		  study that phytoliths dissolution rates exhibit a minimum
		  at {pH} ∼3. Mass-normalized dissolution rates are similar
		  among all four types of plant species studied and these
		  rates are an order of magnitude higher than those of
		  typical soil clay minerals. The minimal half life time of
		  larch and horsetail phytoliths in the interstitial soil
		  solution ranges from 10–12 years at {pH}=2–3 to
		  {\textless}1 year at {pH} above 6, comparable with mean

  shorttitle	= {Silicon dynamics in the rhizosphere},
  abstract	= {Silicon (Si) is a beneficial element for plants as it
		  increases their resistance to several biotic and abiotic
		  stresses. In the rhizosphere, root exudates, especially
		  when released by nutritionally stressed plants, promote the
		  mineral weathering and, consequently, influence Si
		  biogeochemistry. This study aims at evaluating the
		  mineralogical alterations in the rhizosphere of
		  Fe-deficient or Fe-sufficient barley plants grown either in
		  a natural or in an artificial calcareous soil, focusing on
		  the dynamics of both Fe and Si. After 6 d of soil–plant
		  contact, X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) analysis of rhizosphere
		  soil samples of Fe-deficient plants revealed, for both
		  natural and artificial soil, a decrease of amorphous phases
		  and an increase of smectite compared to the unplanted soil.
		  Root exudates released by Fe-deficient plants were most
		  likely the main responsible for the weathering of the
		  amorphous phases by a ligand controlled dissolution
		  mechanism. When the soil–plant contact was prolonged up
		  to 12 d, plants overcame Fe nutritional stress and their
		  effect on soil mineralogy completely changed, as proved by
		  the considerable increase of amorphous and decrease of
		  smectite. Smectite decrease might evidence the effort of
		  plant to mobilize Si and micronutrients other than Fe from
		  the soil through the exudation of organic ligands. When the
		  artificial soil was treated with Fe-sufficient barley
		  plants, the mineral weathering trend appeared reversed
		  compared to the experiments with Fe-deficient plants. Plant
		  nutritional status regulates the root exudation pattern
		  and, consequently, drives mineral weathering processes in
		  the rhizosphere. Barley has shown to be able to mobilize Si
		  from smectite, yet depending on its Fe supply and proving
		  the strict connection between Si and Fe dynamics in the
		  rhizosphere.},

		  plants},
  abstract	= {Silicon (Si) is a metalloid which is gaining worldwide
		  attention of plant scientists due to its ameliorating
		  impact on plants' growth and development. The beneficial
		  response of Si is observed predominantly under numerous
		  abiotic and biotic stress conditions. However, under
		  favorable conditions, most of the plant can grow without
		  it. Therefore, Si has yet not been fully accepted as
		  essential element rather it is being considered as
		  quasi-essential for plants' growth. Si is also known to
		  enhance resilience in plants by reducing the plant's
		  stress. Besides its second most abundance on the earth
		  crust, most of the soils lack plant available form of Si
		  i.e. silicic acid. In this regard, understanding the role
		  of Si in plant metabolism, its uptake from roots and
		  transport to aerial tissues along with its ionomics and
		  proteomics under different circumstances is of great
		  concern. Plants have evolved a well-optimized Si-transport
		  system including various transporter proteins like Low
		  silicon1 (Lsi1), Low silicon2 (Lsi2), Low silicon3 (Lsi3)
		  and Low silicon6 (Lsi6) at specific sub-cellular locations
		  along with the expression profiling that creates precisely
		  coordinated network among these transporters, which also
		  facilitate uptake and accumulation of Si. Though, an ample
		  amount of information is available pertinent to the solute
		  specificity, active sites, transcriptional and
		  post-transcriptional regulation of these transporter genes.
		  Similarly, the information regarding transporters involved
		  in Si accumulation in different organelles is also
		  available particularly in silica cells occurred in poales.
		  But in this review, we have attempted to compile studies
		  related to plants vis à vis Si, its role in abiotic and
		  biotic stress, its uptake in various parts of plants via
		  different types of Si-transporters, expression pattern,
		  localization and the solute specificity. Besides these,
		  this review will also provide the compiled knowledge about
		  the genetic variation among crop plants vis à vis enhanced
		  Si uptake and related benefits.},

  abstract	= {Elevated atmospheric {CO}2 ({eCO}2) not only increases
		  plant growth but can also interfere with defence against
		  insect herbivory through the disruption of the jasmonic
		  acid ({JA}) pathway. Silicon (Si) plays an important role
		  in plant stress tolerance and resistance to herbivory,
		  particularly in grasses, many of which accumulate high
		  amounts of Si. Activation of the {JA} pathway has been
		  reported to stimulate Si uptake, while Si supplementation
		  can alter both constitutive and induced phytohormone
		  levels. A reduction in {JA} concentration under {eCO}2 has
		  the potential to reduce Si uptake in plants. Using both Si
		  supplemented (Si+) and control (Si−) plants (Brachypodium
		  distachyon) grown under ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (640
		  ppm) {CO}2 concentrations, we tested how plant growth,
		  foliar Si concentration and endogenous {JA} responded to
		  methyl jasmonate ({MeJA}) application and the subsequent
		  effects on insect herbivore performance (Helicoverpa
		  armigera). Elevated {CO}2 reduced Si concentration by 19\%
		  and endogenous {JA} by 70\% on average. {MeJA}
		  significantly increased Si concentration in Si+ plants. Si+
		  plants had higher baseline {JA} levels compared to Si−
		  plants under control conditions (i.e. no stress), however,
		  when plants were chemically induced with {MeJA}, the {JA}
		  response was on average 84\% lower in Si+ plants compared
		  to Si− plants. Plants without {MeJA} treatment showed the
		  opposite response, that is, Si+ plants had higher baseline
		  {JA} levels compared to Si− plants. Si significantly
		  reduced herbivore consumption and growth rate. Despite
		  {eCO}2 significantly reducing both Si and endogenous {JA},
		  no effect was seen on herbivores feeding on {eCO}2 plants.
		  Collectively our results suggest that Si alters the {JA}
		  response of plants. We show that {JA} induces Si uptake,
		  however, Si then reduces the {JA} response of plants under
		  induced stress conditions. However, predicted increases in
		  {CO}2 levels within this century may significantly reduce

  abstract	= {Elevated atmospheric {CO}2 ({eCO}2) not only increases
		  plant growth but can also interfere with defence against
		  insect herbivory through the disruption of the jasmonic
		  acid ({JA}) pathway. Silicon (Si) plays an important role
		  in plant stress tolerance and resistance to herbivory,
		  particularly in grasses, many of which accumulate high
		  amounts of Si. Activation of the {JA} pathway has been
		  reported to stimulate Si uptake, while Si supplementation
		  can alter both constitutive and induced phytohormone
		  levels. A reduction in {JA} concentration under {eCO}2 has
		  the potential to reduce Si uptake in plants. Using both Si
		  supplemented (Si+) and control (Si−) plants (Brachypodium
		  distachyon) grown under ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (640
		  ppm) {CO}2 concentrations, we tested how plant growth,
		  foliar Si concentration and endogenous {JA} responded to
		  methyl jasmonate ({MeJA}) application and the subsequent
		  effects on insect herbivore performance (Helicoverpa
		  armigera). Elevated {CO}2 reduced Si concentration by 19\%
		  and endogenous {JA} by 70\% on average. {MeJA}
		  significantly increased Si concentration in Si+ plants. Si+
		  plants had higher baseline {JA} levels compared to Si−
		  plants under control conditions (i.e. no stress), however,
		  when plants were chemically induced with {MeJA}, the {JA}
		  response was on average 84\% lower in Si+ plants compared
		  to Si− plants. Plants without {MeJA} treatment showed the
		  opposite response, that is, Si+ plants had higher baseline
		  {JA} levels compared to Si− plants. Si significantly
		  reduced herbivore consumption and growth rate. Despite
		  {eCO}2 significantly reducing both Si and endogenous {JA},
		  no effect was seen on herbivores feeding on {eCO}2 plants.
		  Collectively our results suggest that Si alters the {JA}
		  response of plants. We show that {JA} induces Si uptake,
		  however, Si then reduces the {JA} response of plants under
		  induced stress conditions. However, predicted increases in
		  {CO}2 levels within this century may significantly reduce
		  Si-based mechanical defences against herbivory via a
		  reduction of endogenous {JA}. A free Plain Language Summary

  abstract	= {Silicon (Si) plays an important role in improving soil
		  nutrient availability and plant carbon (C) accumulation and
		  may therefore impact the biogeochemical cycles of C,
		  nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in terrestrial ecosystems
		  profoundly. However, research on this process in grassland
		  ecosystems is scarce, despite the fact that these
		  ecosystems are one of the most significant accumulators of
		  biogenic Si ({BSi}). In this study, we collected the
		  aboveground parts of four widespread grasses and soil
		  profile samples in northern China and assessed the
		  correlations between Si concentrations and stoichiometry
		  and accumulation of C, N, and P in grasses at the landscape
		  scale. Our results showed that Si concentrations in plants
		  were significantly negatively correlated (p {\textless}
		  0.01) with associated C concentrations. There was no
		  significant correlation between Si and N concentrations. It
		  is worth noting that since the Si concentration increased,
		  the P concentration increased from less than 0.10\% to more
		  than 0.20\% and therefore C:P and N:P ratios decreased
		  concomitantly. Besides, the soil noncrystalline Si played
		  more important role in C, N, and P accumulation than other
		  environmental factors (e.g., {MAT}, {MAP}, and altitude).
		  These findings indicate that Si may facilitate grasses in
		  adjusting the utilization of nutrients (C, N, and P) and
		  may particularly alleviate P deficiency in grasslands. We
		  conclude that Si positively alters the concentrations and
		  accumulation of C, N, and P likely resulting in the
		  variation of ecological stoichiometry in both vegetation
		  and litter decomposition in soils. This study further
		  suggests that the physiological function of Si is an
		  important but overlooked factor in influencing
		  biogeochemical cycles of C and P in grassland ecosystems.},

  abstract	= {Our current understanding of silicon (Si) availability in
		  agricultural soils is reviewed and knowledge gaps are
		  highlighted. Silicon is a beneficial rather than essential
		  plant nutrient and yield responses to its application have
		  been frequently demonstrated in Si-accumulator crops such
		  as rice and sugarcane. These crops are typically grown on
		  highly weathered (desilicated) soils where soil solution Si
		  concentrations are low. Increased yields are the result of
		  simultaneous increases in plant tolerance to a wide range
		  of biotic (plant pathogens, insect pests) and abiotic
		  (water shortage, excess salts, metal toxicities) stresses.
		  Traditionally, soil solution Si is viewed as being supplied
		  by dissolution of primary and secondary minerals and
		  buffered by adsorption/desorption of silicate onto Al and
		  Fe hydrous oxide surfaces. In recent years it has become
		  recognized that phytogenic cycling of Si [uptake of Si by
		  plants, formation of phytogenic silica ({SiO}2 · {nH}2O)
		  mainly in leaves and subsequent return of this silica to
		  soils in plant litter] is the main determinant of soil
		  solution Si concentrations in natural forests and
		  grasslands. Considerable diminution of the phytogenic Si
		  pool in agricultural soils is likely due to regular removal
		  of Si in harvested products. A range of extractants
		  (unbuffered salts, acetate-based solutions, and acids) can
		  provide valuable information on the Si status of soils and
		  the likelihood of a yield response in rice and sugarcane.
		  The most common Si fertilizers used are industrial
		  byproducts (e.g., blast furnace slag, steel slag,
		  ferromanganous slag, Ca slag). Since agriculture promotes
		  soil desilication and Si is presently being promoted as a
		  broad spectrum plant prophylactic, the future use of Si in
		  agriculture is likely to increase. Aspects that require
		  future research include the role of specific adsorption of
		  silicate onto hydrous oxides, the significance of
		  phytogenic Si in agricultural soils, the extent of loss of
		  phytogenic Si due to crop harvest, the role of
		  hydroxyaluminosilicate formation in fertilized soils, and
		  the effect of soil {pH} on Si availability.},

		  typically favor slow-growing, well-defended plants. The
		  prevailing hypothesis explaining this pattern states that,
		  as resource availability increases, well-defended,
		  slow-growing species are replaced by poorly defended,
		  fast-growing species. A second hypothesis states that
		  greater resource availability increases allocation to
		  growth at the expense of defense, within species.
		  Regardless of mechanism, if exotic species are released
		  from enemies relative to natives, shifts in allocation to
		  growth and defense both within and among species could
		  differ by geographic provenance. To test whether resource
		  availability alters growth or defense, within and among
		  species, and whether any such effects differ between
		  natives and exotics, we manipulated soil nutrient supply
		  and access of aboveground insect herbivores and fungal
		  pathogens under field conditions to individuals of six
		  native and six exotic grass species that co-occurred in a
		  North Carolina old field. The prevailing hypothesis’
		  prediction—that species-level enemy impact increases with
		  species’ nutrient responsiveness—was confirmed.
		  Moreover, this relationship did not differ between native
		  and exotic species. The second hypothesis’
		  prediction—that individual-level enemy impact increases
		  with nutrient supply, after accounting for species-level
		  variation in performance—was not supported. Together,
		  these results support the idea, across native and exotic
		  species, that plant species turnover is the primary
		  mechanism underlying effects of nutrient enrichment on
		  allocation to growth and defense in plant communities.},

		  eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. {NUTS} uses
		  a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate
		  points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution,
		  stopping automatically when it starts to double back and
		  retrace its steps. Empirically, {NUTS} perform at least as
		  efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well
		  tuned standard {HMC} method, without requiring user
		  intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method
		  for adapting the step size parameter
		  \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual
		  averaging. {NUTS} can thus be used with no hand-tuning at
		  all. {NUTS} is also suitable for applications such as
		  {BUGS}-style automatic inference engines that require
		  efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

		  availability in the upper soil vary spatially within a 2 ha
		  area in a lowland Dipterocarp forest in Peninsular
		  Malaysia. Silicon concentration per unit leaf dry mass of
		  86 dominant tree species in this plot ranged from 0.4 to
		  126 mg/g. Soil Si availability at 100 sampling points and
		  Si flux via leaf litter at 66 litter traps showed large
		  variations up to 3.3- and 17.9-folds, respectively.
		  However, they correlated neither with each other nor with
		  the expected Si flux from tree species composition in the
		  neighborhood. When we classified tree species to four
		  groups by their leaf Si concentrations (negligible, low,
		  moderate and high), tree species with moderate leaf Si
		  concentrations were significantly more abundant on Si-rich
		  soils. In contrast, the other three groups did not show any
		  significant spatial relationships with soil Si
		  availability. These results indicate that soil Si
		  availability, Si accumulation by vegetation and Si flux via
		  leaf litter show wide spatial variations in a lowland
		  tropical forest, without a simple relationship with each

		  It has been hypothesised that grasses, in particular,

		  concentrations, the relationship between nitrogen (N)

		  limitation on constitutive physical Si defences (e.g.

		  We determined how N limitation affected Si deposition in

		  Helicoverpa armigera growth rates. We used scanning
		  electron microscopy ({SEM}) and energy dispersive X-ray

		  quantify physical structures on leaves and determine Si
		  deposition patterns. We also determined how N limitation
		  and Si supply impacted the jasmonic acid ({JA}) pathway,
		  the master regulator of induced defences against arthropod
		  herbivores. N limitation reduced shoot growth by over 40\%,
		  but increased root mass (+21\%), leaf Si concentrations
		  (+50\%) and the density of silica (+28\%) and flattened
		  prickle (+76\%) cells. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
		  and {XRM} established that Si was being deposited in these
		  structures, together with hooked prickle cells and
		  macro-hairs. Herbivore relative growth rates ({RGR}) were
		  more than 115\% lower in Si-supplied plants compared to
		  plants without Si supply and negatively correlated with
		  leaf Si concentration and silica cell density. {RGR} was
		  further reduced by N limitation and positively correlated
		  with leaf N concentrations. Increases in {JA}
		  concentrations following induction of the {JA} pathway were

		  chain from soil through plant to animal. Soil solution is
		  the immediate source of the silica that is always absorbed

		  content of plants include: soil {pH} and the content of
		  iron and aluminum oxides present in plants. Plants take up
		  different amounts of silica, according to their species.
		  Silicon sometimes has a beneficial effect through
		  alleviating manganese toxicity. Silicon alters the
		  distribution of manganese in the leaf tissues, thereby
		  preventing it from collecting into localized areas that
		  become necrotic. The presence of silica in pasture plants
		  ensures that grazing ruminants ingest rather large amounts
		  of silica, most of which is in the solid form. Apart from
		  slight dissolution, this silica is unchanged in passing
		  along the alimentary tract and its known effects on the
		  animal are physical or mechanical. The dissolved silica
		  that is absorbed from the alimentary tract is carried to
		  the kidney and excreted in the urine. Although it is
		  normally excreted readily, the silica is sometimes
		  deposited to form calculi or uroliths that can cause

  abstract	= {A recent surge in attention devoted to the ecology of soil
		  biota has prompted interest in quantifying similarities and
		  differences between interactions occurring in above- and
		  belowground communities. Furthermore, linkages that
		  interconnect the dynamics of these two spatially distinct
		  ecosystems are increasingly documented. We use a similar
		  approach in the context of understanding plant defenses to
		  herbivory, including how they are allocated between leaves
		  and roots (constitutive defenses), and potential
		  cross-system linkages (induced defenses). To explore these
		  issues we utilized three different empirical approaches.
		  First, we manipulated foliar and root herbivory on tobacco
		  (Nicotiana tabacum) and measured changes in the secondary
		  chemistry of above- and belowground tissues. Second, we
		  reviewed published studies that compared levels of
		  secondary chemistry between leaves and roots to determine
		  how plants distribute putative defense chemicals across the
		  above- and belowground systems. Last, we used meta-analysis
		  to quantify the impact of induced responses across plant
		  tissue types. In the tobacco system, leaf-chewing insects
		  strongly induced higher levels of secondary metabolites in
		  leaves but had no impact on root chemistry. Nematode root
		  herbivores, however, elicited changes in both leaves and
		  roots. Virtually all secondary chemicals measured were
		  elevated in nematode-induced galls, whereas the impact of
		  root herbivory on foliar chemistry was highly variable and
		  depended on where chemicals were produced within the plant.
		  Importantly, nematodes interfered with aboveground
		  metabolites that have biosynthetic sites located in roots
		  (e.g., nicotine) but had the opposite effect (i.e.,
		  nematodes elevated foliar expression) on chemicals produced
		  in shoots (e.g., phenolics and terpenoids). Results from
		  our literature review suggest that, overall, constitutive
		  defense levels are extremely similar when comparing leaves
		  with roots, although certain chemical classes (e.g.,
		  alkaloids, glucosinolates) are differentially allocated
		  between above- and belowground parts. Based on a
		  meta-analysis of induced defense studies we conclude that:
		  (1) foliar induction generates strong responses in leaves,
		  but much weaker responses in roots, and (2) root induction
		  elicits responses of equal magnitude in both leaves and
		  roots. We discuss the importance of this asymmetry and the
		  paradox of cross-system induction in relation to optimal
		  defense theory and interactions between above- and
		  belowground herbivory.},

  abstract	= {{SummaryArtificial} damage is a popular method in
		  plant-herbivore studies, because the use of real herbivores
		  is often laborious and because it may be virtually
		  impossible to use herbivores in many experimental setups.
		  We made a literature search of studies that tested whether
		  natural and artificial damage have similar effects on
		  plants. Of 46 studies found, 33 (72\%) reported a
		  significant difference between responses to artificial and
		  natural herbivore damage in at least one of the statistical
		  tests included. The studies contained 280 statistical
		  tests, of which 99 (35\%) showed a significant difference
		  between artificial and natural damage. Phytochemical
		  responses to artificial and natural damage were different
		  in 41\% of the statistical tests and 75\% of the studies
		  found at least one significant difference. Plant
		  resistance, measured as secondary damage, herbivore
		  performance, fungal growth in damaged tissue or plant
		  attractivity to parasitoids of herbivores, differed in 60\%
		  of the statistical tests and 85\% of the studies had
		  significant differences. Growth, reproduction and
		  physiological responses to artificial and natural damage
		  differed in 20–30\% of statistical tests and 50–83\% of
		  studies had significant differences. Thus, studies on plant
		  tolerance (growth and reproduction after damage) more often
		  showed similar effects for artificial and natural damage
		  than studies on plant resistance to herbivory, but even in
		  tolerance studies artificial and natural damage often have
		  different effects. Some studies indicated that application
		  of herbivore saliva and careful imitation of timing and
		  spatial pattern of damage helped in reaching the same
		  effect with simulations and natural damage.},

		  apparent in terms of decision speed: predators were slower
		  to orient towards damaged crops than to damaged wild
		  relatives. By contrast, M. sexta moths were more likely to
		  oviposit on domesticated than on wild or landrace tomatoes,
		  indicating that insect responses to plant odours vary with
		  trophic level. Field trials confirmed olfactory preference
		  tests: caterpillars recovered from wild tomato relatives
		  were more likely to be parasitized than those recovered
		  from landraces or domesticated tomatoes. The results of the

  abstract	= {Low phosphorus availability is a primary constraint to
		  plant productivity in many natural and agricultural
		  ecosystems. Plants display a wide array of adaptive
		  responses to low phosphorus availability that generally
		  serve to enhance phosphorus mobility in the soil and
		  increase its uptake. One set of adaptive responses is the
		  alteration of root architecture to increase phosphorus
		  acquisition from the soil at minimum metabolic cost. In a
		  series of studies with the common bean, work in our
		  laboratory has shown that architectural traits that enhance
		  topsoil foraging appear to be particularly important for
		  genotypic adaptation to low phosphorus soils (‘phosphorus
		  efficiency’). In particular, the gravitropic trajectory
		  of basal roots, adventitious rooting, the dispersion of
		  lateral roots, and the plasticity of these processes in
		  response to phosphorus availability contribute to
		  phosphorus efficiency in this species. These traits enhance
		  the exploration and exploitation of shallow soil horizons,
		  where phosphorus availability is greatest in many soils.
		  Studies with computer models of root architecture show that
		  root systems with enhanced topsoil foraging acquire
		  phosphorus more efficiently than others of equivalent size.
		  Comparisons of contrasting genotypes in controlled
		  environments and in the field show that plants with better
		  topsoil foraging have superior phosphorus acquisition and
		  growth in low phosphorus soils. It appears that many
		  architectural responses to phosphorus stress may be
		  mediated by the plant hormone ethylene. Genetic mapping of
		  these traits shows that they are quantitatively inherited
		  but can be tagged with {QTLs} that can be used in plant
		  breeding programs. New crop genotypes incorporating these
		  traits have substantially improved yield in low phosphorus
		  soils, and are being deployed in Africa and Latin

  abstract	= {Silicon (Si) is the second most abundant element, either
		  on the basis of weight or number of atoms, in the earth’s
		  crust. Because of its strong affinity with oxygen, in
		  nature Si always exists as silica (Si dioxide) or silicates
		  which are combined with various metals. Si dioxide
		  comprises about 60\% of the earth’s crust. In soil, Si
		  dioxide accounts for more than 50\% and Si concentration in
		  soil solution is between 3.5 and 40 mg Si L-1 in the form
		  of silicic acid (Marscner 1995). Therefore, all plants
		  rooting in soil contain Si in their tissues.However,
		  because of its universal existence, earlier researchers
		  paid little attention to the impact of Si on plant growth.
		  Sacks (1862) first asked the following question in his
		  article on Si nutrition “… whether silicic acid is an
		  indispensable substance for those plants that contain
		  silica,whether it takes part in nutritional processes, and
		  what is the relationship that exists between silicic acid
		  and the life of the plant.” However, Sachs concluded that
		  Si was insignificant for the nutritional process of maize
		  when he found that water-cultured maize which contained
		  0.3\% Si did not show any abnormality in growth compared to
		  maize containing 9\% Si. Since then, a number of studies
		  have been carried out on the effect of Si on plant
		  grwoth.However, until now Si has not been put in the list
		  of essential elements for higher plants.According to the
		  criteria proposed by Arnon and Stout (1939) for essential
		  elements, a given plant must be unable to complete its life
		  cycle in the absence of the element.},

		  dynamics. These effects are well established for chemical
		  defences, but induction of physical defences remains far
		  less studied. However, for many plants, it is physical
		  defences that play the major role in regulating the levels
		  of herbivore damage sustained. We provide evidence that, in
		  grasses, induction of physical defences is both specific to
		  herbivore feeding, as opposed to mechanical damage, and may
		  be dependant on the amount of damage imposed. Furthermore,
		  we show that the magnitude of the induction response is
		  sufficient to deter further damage and affect herbivore
		  performance. We compared silica induction in two grass
		  species in response to vertebrate and invertebrate damage,
		  and to mechanical defoliation. Induction was assessed at
		  two levels of damage over 16 months. Foliar silica content
		  did not increase in response to mechanical defoliation, but
		  damage by either voles or locusts resulted in increases in
		  silica content of over 400\%. This increase deterred
		  feeding by both voles and locusts. Silica induction in

  abstract	= {Induced plant responses to herbivory have major impacts on
		  herbivore feeding behaviour, performance and population
		  dynamics. These effects are well established for chemical
		  defences, but induction of physical defences remains far
		  less studied. However, for many plants, it is physical
		  defences that play the major role in regulating the levels
		  of herbivore damage sustained. We provide evidence that, in
		  grasses, induction of physical defences is both specific to
		  herbivore feeding, as opposed to mechanical damage, and may
		  be dependant on the amount of damage imposed. Furthermore,
		  we show that the magnitude of the induction response is
		  sufficient to deter further damage and affect herbivore
		  performance. We compared silica induction in two grass
		  species in response to vertebrate and invertebrate damage,
		  and to mechanical defoliation. Induction was assessed at
		  two levels of damage over 16 months. Foliar silica content
		  did not increase in response to mechanical defoliation, but
		  damage by either voles or locusts resulted in increases in
		  silica content of over 400\%. This increase deterred
		  feeding by both voles and locusts. Silica induction in
		  grasses due to repeated damage events over a prolonged
		  period suggests a possible role for silica defence in the
		  cyclical population fluctuations observed in many
		  grass-feeding herbivores.},

		  we characterize the rye mutant ´Stabilstroh’ (‘stable
		  straw’) possessing an exceptional combination of high
		  lodging resistance, tall posture and high biomass
		  production. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging displayed
		  the 3-dimensional assembly of vascular bundles in stem. A
		  higher number of vascular bundles and a higher degree of
		  their incline were the features of lodging-resistant versus
		  lodging-prone lines. Histology and electron microscopy
		  revealed that stems are fortified by a higher proportion of
		  sclerenchyma and thickened cell walls, as well as some
		  epidermal invaginations. Biochemical analysis using
		  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and inductively
		  coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry further
		  identified elevated levels of lignin, xylan, zinc and
		  silicon as features associated with high lodging
		  resistance. Combined effects of above features caused
		  superior culm stability. A simplistic mathematical model
		  showed how mechanical forces distribute within the stem
		  under stress. Main traits of the lodging-resistant parental
		  line were heritable and could be traced back to the genetic
		  structure of the mutant. Evaluation of lodging-resistant

  abstract	= {1. Plant growth is a fundamental ecological process,
		  integrating across scales from physiology to community
		  dynamics and ecosystem properties. Recent improvements in
		  plant growth modelling have allowed deeper understanding
		  and more accurate predictions for a wide range of
		  ecological issues, including competition among plants,
		  plant–herbivore interactions and ecosystem functioning.
		  2. One challenge in modelling plant growth is that, for a
		  variety of reasons, relative growth rate ({RGR}) almost
		  universally decreases with increasing size, although
		  traditional calculations assume that {RGR} is constant.
		  Nonlinear growth models are flexible enough to account for
		  varying growth rates. 3. We demonstrate a variety of
		  nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant
		  growth and, for each, show how to calculate
		  function-derived growth rates, which allow unbiased
		  comparisons among species at a common time or size. We show
		  how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to
		  express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting nonlinear
		  models can be challenging, so we present extensive worked
		  examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in
		  R. 4. The use of nonlinear models coupled with
		  function-derived growth rates can facilitate the testing of
		  novel hypotheses in population and community ecology. For
		  example, the use of such techniques has allowed better
		  understanding of the components of {RGR}, the costs of
		  rapid growth and the linkage between host and parasite
		  growth rates. We hope this contribution will demystify
		  nonlinear modelling and persuade more ecologists to use
		  these techniques.},

  abstract	= {Awns are long, stiff filamentous extensions of glumes in
		  many grasses. In wheat, awns contribute up to 40\% of the
		  grain's photosynthetic assimilates, and assist in seed
		  dispersal. Awns accumulate silica in epidermal hairs and
		  papillae, and silica has been positively associated with
		  yield and environmental stress tolerance. Here, the awns of
		  a set of domesticated wheat genotypes and their direct
		  progenitor, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides were
		  characterized. In addition, the silica concentration in
		  awns was genetically dissected in a tetraploid wheat
		  population of recombinant inbred lines ({RILs}) derived
		  from a cross between durum wheat (cv. Langdon) and wild
		  emmer (accession G18-16). Scanning electron micrographs
		  revealed a continuous silica layer under the cuticle.
		  Extended silicification was identified in the epidermis
		  cell wall and in sclerenchyma cells near the vascular
		  bundles, but not in the stomata, suggesting that an active
		  process directs the soluble silica away from the water
		  evaporation stream. The number of silicified cells was
		  linearly correlated to silica concentration in dry weight
		  ({DW}), suggesting cellular control over silicification.
		  Domesticated wheat awns contained up to 19\% silica per
		  {DW}, as compared with 7\% in the wild accessions,
		  suggesting selection pressure associated with the
		  domestication process. Six quantitative trait loci ({QTLs})
		  for silica were identified in the awns, with a {LOD} score
		  of 3.7–6.3, three of which overlapped genomic regions
		  that contribute to high grain protein. Localization of

		  studies have quantified the reproductive price of induced
		  defenses, which represent the best means of measuring such
		  costs in isolation from the genotypic costs that confound
		  research involving constitutive defenses. Jasmonic acid
		  ({JA}) is a plant signal molecule involved in the defensive
		  responses of plants. It induces many of the same chemicals
		  that are associated with herbivore damage, and thus offers
		  a means of inducing plants without the removal of leaf
		  area, which incurs its own costs. In tomato plants, {JA}
		  induced resistance to Manduca sexta and increased levels of
		  two defensive enzymes, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase.
		  We measured the impact of {JA}-induced defenses in tomato,
		  Lycopersicon esculentum (Solanaceae), on several variables
		  associated with reproductive success: fruit number, fruit
		  weight, ripening time, time of fruit-set, number of seeds
		  per fruit, total seeds per plant, the relationship between
		  fruit weight and seed number, and germination success.
		  Plants were grown in a pest-free greenhouse and treated
		  biweekly with solvent or with {JA} at either of two
		  concentrations: 10 {mM} or 1 {mM}. The high concentration
		  of {JA} led to fewer but larger fruits, longer ripening
		  time, delayed fruit-set, fewer seeds per plant, and fewer
		  seeds per unit of fruit weight. The reproductive impact of
		  induction was reduced at the lower dose, but still
		  significant; 1 {mM} {JA} resulted in delayed fruit-set and
		  fewer seeds per unit of fruit weight, compared to control
		  plants. Our research indicates that {JA}-induced defenses

		  frequently employed tool across biological disciplines, yet
		  accurate, convenient and economical methods for the
		  determination of some important elements are currently
		  lacking. For instance, digestion-based techniques are often
		  hazardous and time-consuming and, particularly in the case
		  of silicon (Si), can suffer from low accuracy due to
		  incomplete solubilization and potential volatilization,
		  whilst other methods may require large, expensive and
		  specialised equipment. • Here, we present a rapid, safe
		  and accurate procedure for the simultaneous, nonconsumptive
		  analysis of Si and phosphorus (P) in as little as 0.1 g
		  dried and ground plant material using a portable X-ray
		  fluorescence spectrometer (P-{XRF}). • We used certified
		  reference materials from different plant species to test
		  the analytical performance of P-{XRF} and show that the
		  analysis suffers from very little bias and that the
		  repeatability precision of the measurements is as good as
		  or better than that of other methods. • Using this
		  technique we were able to process and analyse 200 ground
		  samples a day, so P-{XRF} could provide a particularly
		  valuable tool for plant biologists requiring the

  abstract	= {• The elemental analysis of plant material is a
		  frequently employed tool across biological disciplines, yet
		  accurate, convenient and economical methods for the
		  determination of some important elements are currently
		  lacking. For instance, digestion-based techniques are often
		  hazardous and time-consuming and, particularly in the case
		  of silicon (Si), can suffer from low accuracy due to
		  incomplete solubilization and potential volatilization,
		  whilst other methods may require large, expensive and
		  specialised equipment. • Here, we present a rapid, safe
		  and accurate procedure for the simultaneous, nonconsumptive
		  analysis of Si and phosphorus (P) in as little as 0.1 g
		  dried and ground plant material using a portable X-ray
		  fluorescence spectrometer (P-{XRF}). • We used certified
		  reference materials from different plant species to test
		  the analytical performance of P-{XRF} and show that the
		  analysis suffers from very little bias and that the
		  repeatability precision of the measurements is as good as
		  or better than that of other methods. • Using this
		  technique we were able to process and analyse 200 ground
		  samples a day, so P-{XRF} could provide a particularly
		  valuable tool for plant biologists requiring the
		  simultaneous nonconsumptive analysis of multiple elements,
		  including those known to be difficult to measure such as
		  Si, in large numbers of samples.},

  abstract	= {Silicon has generally not been considered essential for
		  plant growth, although it is well recognized that many
		  plants, particularly Poaceae, have substantial plant tissue
		  concentrations of this element. Recently, however, the
		  International Plant Nutrition Institute [{IPNI}] (2015),
		  Georgia, {USA} has listed it as a “beneficial
		  substance”. This reflects that numerous studies have now
		  established that silicon may alleviate both biotic and
		  abiotic stress. This paper explores the existing knowledge
		  and recent advances in elucidating the role of silicon in
		  plant defense against biotic stress, particularly against
		  arthropod pests in agriculture and attraction of beneficial
		  insects. Silicon confers resistance to herbivores via two
		  described mechanisms: physical and biochemical/molecular.
		  Until recently, studies have mainly centered on two trophic
		  levels; the herbivore and plant. However, several studies
		  now describe tri-trophic effects involving silicon that
		  operate by attracting predators or parasitoids to plants
		  under herbivore attack. Indeed, it has been demonstrated
		  that silicon-treated, arthropod-attacked plants display
		  increased attractiveness to natural enemies, an effect that
		  was reflected in elevated biological control in the field.
		  The reported relationships between soluble silicon and the
		  jasmonic acid ({JA}) defense pathway, and {JA} and
		  herbivore-induced plant volatiles ({HIPVs}) suggest that
		  soluble silicon may enhance the production of {HIPVs}.
		  Further, it is feasible that silicon uptake may affect
		  protein expression (or modify proteins structurally) so
		  that they can produce additional, or modify, the {HIPV}
		  profile of plants. Ultimately, understanding silicon under
		  plant ecological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular
		  contexts will assist in fully elucidating the mechanisms
		  behind silicon and plant response to biotic stress at both
		  the bi- and tri-trophic levels.},

		  This paper examines the latest research on selected soil

		  limited in identifying direct impacts of soil degradation
		  on food production. Some soil management practices have
		  been used to mask the effects of soil degradation on food
		  production (e.g., additions of chemical fertilisers), but
		  comprehensive soil conservation practices are required to
		  respond to the multiple problems of soil degradation if the

		  in arctic ecosystems and herbivory is also known to have a
		  strong influence on the biomass and composition of
		  vegetation. However, research combining herbivory with
		  warming is largely lacking. Our study describes how warming
		  and simulated herbivory affect vegetation, soil nutrient
		  concentrations and soil microbial communities after 10–13
		  years of exposure. 2 We established a factorial warming and
		  herbivory-simulation experiment at a subarctic tundra heath
		  in Kilpisjärvi, Finland, in 1994. Warming was carried out
		  using the open-top chamber setup of the International
		  Tundra Experiment ({ITEX}). Wounding of the dominant
		  deciduous dwarf shrub Vaccinium myrtillus L. to simulate
		  herbivory was carried out annually. We measured vegetation
		  cover in 2003 and 2007, soil nutrient concentrations in
		  2003 and 2006, soil microbial respiration in 2003, and
		  composition and function of soil microbial communities in
		  2006. 3 Warming increased the cover of V. myrtillus,
		  whereas other plant groups did not show any response.
		  Simulated herbivory of V. myrtillus cancelled out the
		  impact of warming on the species cover, and increased the
		  cover of other dwarf shrubs. 4 The concentrations of –N,
		  and microbial biomass C and N in the soil were
		  significantly reduced by warming after 10 treatment years
		  but not after 13 treatment years. The reduction in –N by
		  warming was significant only without simultaneous herbivory
		  treatment, which indicates that simulated herbivory reduced
		  N uptake by vegetation. 5 Soil microbial community
		  composition, based on phospholipid fatty acid ({PLFA})
		  analysis, was slightly altered by warming. The activity of
		  cultivable bacterial and fungal communities was
		  significantly increased by warming and the substrate
		  utilization patterns were influenced by warming and
		  herbivory. 6 Synthesis. Our results show that warming
		  increases the cover of V. myrtillus, which seems to enhance
		  the nutrient sink strength of vegetation in the studied
		  ecosystem. However, herbivory partially negates the effect
		  of warming on plant N uptake and interacts with the effect
		  of warming on microbial N immobilization. Our study
		  demonstrates that effects of warming on soil microorganisms
		  are likely to differ in the presence and absence of
		  herbivores.},

  abstract	= {Potassium (K) distribution is horizontally heterogeneous
		  under the conservation agriculture approach of no-till with
		  strip fertilization. The root foraging strategy of wheat
		  for K heterogeneity is poorly understood. In this study,
		  {WinRHIZO}, microarray, Non-invasive Micro-test Technology
		  ({NMT}) and a split-root system were performed to
		  investigate root morphology, gene expression profiling and
		  fluxes of K+ and O2 under K heterogeneity and homogeneity
		  conditions. The split-root system was performed as follows:
		  C. {LK} (both compartments had low K), C. {NK} (both
		  compartments had normal K), Sp. {LK} (one compartment had
		  low K) and Sp. {NK} (the other compartment had normal K).
		  The ratio of total root length and root tips in Sp. {NK}
		  was significantly higher than that in C. {NK}, while no
		  significant differences were found between Sp. {LK} and C.
		  {LK}. Differential expression genes in C. {LK} vs. C. {NK}
		  had opposite responses in Sp. {LK} vs. C. {LK} and similar
		  responses in Sp. {NK} vs. C. {NK}. Low-K responsive genes,
		  such as peroxidases, mitochondrion, transcription factor
		  activity, calcium ion binding, glutathione transferase and
		  cellular respiration genes were found to be up-regulated in
		  Sp. {NK}. However, methyltransferase activity, protein
		  amino acid phosphorylation, potassium ion transport, and
		  protein kinase activity genes were found to be
		  down-regulated in Sp. {LK}. The up-regulated gene with
		  function in respiration tended to increase K+ uptake
		  through improving O2 influx on the root surface in Sp.
		  {NK}, while the down-regulated genes with functions of K+
		  and O2 transport tended to reduce K+ uptake on the root
		  surface in Sp. {LK}. To summarize, wheat roots tended to
		  perform active-foraging strategies in Sp. {NK} and
		  dormant-foraging strategies in Sp. {LK} through the
		  following patterns: (1) root development in Sp. {NK} but
		  not in Sp. {LK}; (2) low-K responsive genes, such as
		  peroxidases, mitochondrion, transcription factor activity,
		  calcium ion binding and respiration, were up-regulated in
		  Sp. {NK} but not in Sp. {LK}; and (3) root K+ and O2
		  influxes increased in Sp. {NK} but not in Sp. {LK}. Our
		  findings may better explain the optimal root foraging
		  strategy for wheat grown with heterogeneous K distribution
		  in the root zone.},

		  make it impossible to investigate fully the hypothesized
		  causal chain from agricultural intensification to declines

		  We analyze the historical circumstances in which rising

		  national-level United Nations Food and Agricultural
		  Organization data on trends in cropland from 1970–2005,

		  major crop types. Cropland has increased more slowly than
		  population during this period, but paired increases in
		  yields and declines in cropland occurred infrequently, both
		  globally and nationally. Agricultural intensification was
		  not generally accompanied by decline or stasis in cropland
		  area at a national scale during this time period, except in
		  countries with grain imports and conservation set-aside
		  programs. Future projections of cropland abandonment and
		  ensuing environmental services cannot be assumed without

		  a disproportionate share of the contested resources and
		  suppress the growth of their smaller neighbors, a
		  phenomenon called size-asymmetric competition. We review
		  what is known about the mechanisms that give rise to and
		  modify the degree of size asymmetry in competition among
		  plants, and attempt to clarify some of the confusion in the
		  literature on size asymmetry. We broadly distinguish
		  between mechanisms determined primarily by characteristics
		  of contested resource from those that are influenced by the
		  growth and behavior of the plants themselves. To generate
		  size asymmetric resource competition, a resource must be
		  “pre-emptable.” Because of its directionality, light is
		  the primary, but perhaps not the only, example of a
		  pre-emptable resource. The available data suggest that
		  competition for mineral nutrients is often size symmetric
		  (i.e., contested resources are divided in proportion to
		  competitor sizes), but the potential role of patchily
		  and/or episodically supplied nutrients in causing size
		  asymmetry is largely unexplored. Virtually nothing is known
		  about the size symmetry of competition for water.
		  Plasticity in morphology and physiology acts to reduce the
		  degree of size asymmetry in competition. We argue that an
		  allometric perspective on growth, allocation, resource
		  uptake, and resource utilization can help us understand and
		  quantify the mechanisms through which plants compete.},

  abstract	= {Plant phenotypes reflect trade-offs between competing
		  resource-intensive physiological processes. A shift in
		  resource allocation, away from anti-herbivore defences and
		  towards growth and reproduction, is predicted through plant
		  domestication, such that crops are faster growing and
		  higher yielding than their wild ancestors. These changes
		  are hypothesized to have come at the cost of defence
		  investment, leaving crops “disarmed by domestication”.
		  Silicon is the principal anti-herbivore defence in grasses,
		  including many of our most important staple cereal crops,
		  but the impact of domestication on silicon-based defences
		  is unknown. We measured the effects of both domestication
		  and modern agronomic selection on growth rate and a suite
		  of anti-herbivore defences, specifically leaf toughness,
		  silicon and phenolic concentrations. Our comparison of
		  wild, landrace and modern cultivated cereals spanned
		  multiple cereal species, including wheat, barley and maize,
		  sampling eight independent domestication events and five
		  examples of modern agronomic selection. Leaf silicon
		  concentration showed a small, but significant, 10\%
		  reduction through domestication, but there was no effect of
		  modern agronomic selection, and phenolic concentration was
		  not affected by either factor. Silicon concentration
		  correlated positively with leaf tensile strength, but
		  negatively with foliar phenolic concentrations, suggesting
		  a trade-off between chemical and physical defences.
		  Size-standardized growth rate was independent of
		  domestication status, and did not trade-off with silicon or
		  phenolic defences. However, modelling showed that relative
		  growth rate slowed more with increasing size in plants with
		  higher silicon levels, so that they reached a smaller final
		  size, implying a cost of silicon-based defence. We found
		  the opposite pattern for phenolic-based defence, with
		  increasing phenolic concentrations associated with a
		  greater plant size at maturity, and faster maximum relative
		  growth rates. Silicon-based defences have been reduced in
		  cereals through domestication, consistent with our
		  predicted costs of these defences to growth. However,
		  modern agronomic selection has not influenced silicon
		  defences in cereal crops and the small decrease in silicon
		  concentration associated with domestication is unlikely to
		  have a major effect on the ability of cereals to withstand
		  a range of abiotic and biotic stresses. These findings have
		  broad implications for crop protection and our
		  understanding of plant trade-offs. A plain language summary
		  is available for this article.},

  abstract	= {Herbivores can consume significant amounts of plant
		  biomass in many environments. Yet plants are not
		  defenseless against such attack. Although defenses might
		  benefit plants in the presence of herbivores, herbivore
		  attack varies both spatially and temporally, and the
		  expression of plant resistance to herbivores can be costly
		  in the absence of plant enemies. Costs can be described as
		  allocation costs, resource-based tradeoffs between
		  resistance and fitness, or as ecological costs, decreases
		  in fitness resulting from interactions with other species.
		  Here, we update the seminal 1996 Bergelson and Purrington
		  review of resistance costs and find that many more studies
		  have documented costs of resistance (sensu lato) than found
		  during the 1996 survey. Eighty-two percent of studies in
		  which genetic background is controlled, demonstrate
		  significant fitness reductions associated with herbivore
		  resistance. We categorize studies by type of resistance,
		  induced or constitutive, by type of cost, and also by the
		  degree to which investigators controlled for genetic
		  background. Recent work has commonly detected both direct
		  resistance costs, such as resource-based tradeoffs, and
		  ecological costs, which depend on interactions with other
		  species.},

		  seed germination, soil structure, and plant growth; (2)
		  chemical effects of litter on concentrations of soil
		  nutrients and secondary metabolites (e.g., allelopathic

		  herbivory all have been reported as important factors
		  influencing the composition of soil communities. However,
		  most studies thus far have considered these factors in
		  isolation, whereas they strongly interact in the field.
		  Here, we study how grazing by vertebrate herbivores
		  influences the soil nematode community composition of a
		  floodplain grassland while we account for effects of
		  grazing on plant community composition and abiotic soil
		  properties. Nematodes are the most ubiquitous invertebrates
		  in the soil. They include a variety of feeding types,
		  ranging from microbial feeders to herbivores and
		  carnivores, and they perform key functions in soil food
		  webs. Our hypothesis was that grazing affects nematode
		  community structure and composition through altering plant
		  community structure and composition. Alternatively, we
		  tested whether the effects of grazing may, directly or
		  indirectly, run via changes in soil abiotic properties. We
		  used a long-term field experiment containing plots with and
		  without vertebrate grazers (cattle and rabbits). We
		  compared plant and nematode community structure and
		  composition, as well as a number of key soil abiotic
		  properties, and we applied structural equation modeling to
		  investigate four possible pathways by which grazing may
		  change nematode community composition. Aboveground grazing
		  increased plant species richness and reduced both plant and
		  nematode community heterogeneity. There was a positive
		  relationship between plant and nematode diversity indices.
		  Grazing decreased the number of bacterial-feeding
		  nematodes, indicating that in these grasslands, top-down
		  control of plant production by grazing leads to bottom-up
		  control in the basal part of the bacterial channel of the
		  soil food web. According to the structural equation model,
		  grazing had a strong effect on soil abiotic properties and
		  plant community composition, whereas plant community
		  composition was the main determinant of nematode community
		  composition. Other pathways, which assumed that grazing
		  influenced nematode community composition by inducing
		  changes in soil abiotic properties, did not significantly
		  explain variation in nematode community composition. We
		  conclude that grazing-induced changes in nematode community
		  composition mainly operated via changes in plant community
		  composition. Influences of vertebrate grazers on soil
		  nematodes through modification of abiotic soil properties
		  were of less importance.},

  abstract	= {Our understanding of the biology, biochemistry, and
		  genetic development of roots has considerably improved
		  during the last decade (Smith and Fedoroff, 1995; Flores et
		  al., 1999;Benfey and Scheres, 2000). In contrast, the
		  processes mediated by roots in the rhizosphere such as the
		  secretion of root border cells and root exudates are not
		  yet well understood (Hawes et al., 2000). In addition to
		  the classical roles of providing mechanical support and
		  allowing water/nutrient uptake, roots also perform certain
		  specialized roles, including the ability to synthesize,
		  accumulate, and secrete a diverse array of compounds
		  (Flores et al., 1999). Given the complexity and
		  biodiversity of the underground world, roots are clearly
		  not passive targets for soil organisms. Rather, the
		  compounds secreted by plant roots serve important roles as
		  chemical attractants and repellants in the rhizosphere, the
		  narrow zone of soil immediately surrounding the root system
		  (Estabrook and Yoder, 1998; Bais et al., 2001). The
		  chemicals secreted into the soil by roots are broadly
		  referred to as root exudates. Through the exudation of a
		  wide variety of compounds, roots may regulate the soil
		  microbial community in their immediate vicinity, cope with
		  herbivores, encourage beneficial symbioses, change the
		  chemical and physical properties of the soil, and inhibit
		  the growth of competing plant species (Nardi et al., 2000;
		  Fig. 1A). The ability to secrete a vast array of compounds
		  into the rhizosphere is one of the most remarkable
		  metabolic features of plant roots, with nearly 5\% to 21\%
		  of all photosynthetically fixed carbon being transferred to
		  the rhizosphere through root exudates (Marschner,
		  1995).Fig. 1.A, Representation of the complex interactions
		  mediated by root exudates that take place in the
		  rhizosphere between plant roots and other organisms.

		  variability in plant size is best evaluated through
		  measures of inequality such as the Gini Coefficient or the

		  "two-sided" ("resource depletion") predict unchanged or
		  lower size inequality at higher densities after a given
		  period of growth. Models in which competition is
		  "one-sided" ("asymmetric competition") predict higher size
		  inequality at higher densities. Of 16 published experiments
		  which present data on the effects of density on size
		  distributions in monocultures, 14 support the hypothesis
		  that competition between plants is asymmetric. During the
		  development of an even-aged monospecific stand, size
		  inequality increases over time until the onset of
		  self-thinning, then inequality decreases as self-thinning
		  progresses. In two independent data sets we found a linear
		  relationship with a slope near -0.2 between size inequality
		  (as measured by the Gini Coefficient) and log mean plant
		  weight during self-thinning. This trend is also consistent
		  with the asymmetric competition hypothesis. Plant
		  competition is usually "one-sided", and we suggest that
		  this asymmetry is primarily due to competition for light.

		  phenotypes compared with wild ancestors. Crop yields have
		  increased, but a long-held hypothesis is that domestication
		  has also unintentionally decreased plant defences against
		  herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a
		  phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis comparing insect
		  herbivore resistance and putative plant defence traits
		  between crops and their wild relatives. Our database
		  included 2098 comparisons made across 73 crops in 89
		  studies. We found that domestication consistently reduced
		  plant resistance to herbivores, although the magnitude of
		  the effects varied across plant organs and depended on how
		  resistance was measured. However, domestication had no
		  consistent effects on the specific plant defence traits
		  underlying resistance, including secondary metabolites and
		  physical feeding barriers. The values of these traits
		  sometimes increased and sometimes decreased during
		  domestication. Consistent negative effects of domestication
		  were observed only when defence traits were measured in
		  reproductive organs or in the plant organ that was
		  harvested. These results highlight the complexity of
		  evolution under domestication and the need for an improved

		  uptake per unit root dry weight ({SR}={SP}/root dry
		  weight)—of Kinmaze were significantly higher than those

  abstract	= {Plants are simultaneously attacked by a multitude of
		  herbivores that affect plant responses and plant-mediated
		  interactions in a variety of ways. So far, studies on
		  indirect interactions between below- and aboveground
		  herbivores have almost exclusively focused on interactions
		  between only one root and one shoot herbivore species at
		  the same time. Since these studies show a variety of
		  outcomes, we test the hypothesis that root herbivore
		  identity matters in below-/aboveground interactions. We
		  studied the combined effects root-feeding nematodes
		  (Pratylenchus penetrans) and wireworms (Agriotes lineatus
		  larvae) on Plantago lanceolata and on the performance of
		  aboveground phloem-feeding aphids (Myzus persicae) and
		  chewing caterpillars (Chrysodeixis chalcites larvae). Since
		  root herbivores may also affect resource availability and
		  the microbial community in the rhizosphere, we examined
		  resource utilization by soil microorganisms using {BIOLOG}
		  {EcoPlates}™. Wireworms decreased root biomass by 13\%,
		  but led to compensatory shoot growth. Nematodes and the
		  aboveground herbivores did not affect the biomass of
		  Plantago lanceolata. Feeding by C. chalcites larvae
		  enhanced the concentration of aucubin in leaves, which
		  might explain the high mortality of the caterpillars.
		  Aphids and the belowground herbivores did not change
		  iridoid glycoside levels in the leaves. However, the number
		  of aphid offspring was reduced by 44\% when nematodes had
		  been added to the soil, whereas wireworms had no effect. We
		  observed higher utilization of {BIOLOG} carbon sources by
		  the soil microorganisms only in the presence of
		  Pratylenchus penetrans. Our results suggest that the
		  outcome of below–aboveground interactions highly depends
		  on herbivore identity. Zusammenfassung Pflanzen werden
		  gleichzeitig von vielen Herbivoren attackiert, was sowohl
		  die Reaktionen der Pflanze als auch ihre Interaktionen auf
		  vielfältige Weise beeinflusst. Untersuchungen zu
		  indirekten Interaktionen zwischen unter- und oberirdischen
		  Herbivoren haben sich bis jetzt fast ausschließlich auf
		  Interaktionen zwischen einem Wurzel- und einem
		  Sprossherbivor zur selben Zeit beschränkt. Weil diese
		  Untersuchungen unterschiedliche Ergebnisse aufweisen, wird
		  hier die Hypothese getestet, dass die Identität des
		  Wurzelherbivores in Interaktionen zwischen unter- und
		  oberirdischen Herbivoren eine Rolle spielt. Wir
		  untersuchten die Effekte von phytophagen Nematoden
		  (Pratylenchus penetrans) und Drahtwürmern (Agriotes
		  lineatus Larven) auf Spitzwegerich (Plantago lanceolata)
		  und oberirdisch saugende (Myzus persicae) und kauende
		  (Chrysodeixis chalcites Raupen) Herbivore. Da
		  Wurzelherbivore die Verfügbarkeit von Ressourcen und die
		  mikrobielle Gemeinschaft in der Rhizosphäre beeinflussen
		  können, wurde die Ressourcennutzung von Mikroorganismen
		  mit {BIOLOG} {EcoPlates}™ getestet. Drahtwürmer
		  reduzierten die Wurzelbiomasse um 13\%, führten aber zu
		  einem kompensatorischen Sprosswachstum. Nematoden und die
		  oberirdischen Herbivore hatten keinen Einfluss auf die
		  Biomasse von Plantago lanceolata. Der Fraß der C.
		  chalcites Raupen erhöhte die Konzentration von Aucubin in
		  den Blättern, was die hohe Mortalität der Raupen
		  erklären könnte. Blattläuse und die unterirdischen
		  Herbivore beeinflussten die Konzentration der iridoiden
		  Glykoside in den Blättern nicht. Die Anzahl an
		  Blattlausnachkommen war jedoch um 44\% reduziert, wenn
		  Nematoden zum Boden zugefügt worden waren, wohingegen
		  Drahtwürmer keinen Effekt hatten. Wir beobachteten
		  gesteigerte Nutzung der {BIOLOG}™-Kohlenstoffquellen
		  durch die Mikroorganismengemeinschaft, wenn sich
		  Pratylenchus penetrans in der Rhizosphäre befand. Unsere
		  Resultate weisen darauf hin, dass Ergebnisse von
		  Interaktionen zwischen unter- und oberirdischen Herbivoren

  abstract	= {The growth rate ({GR}) hypothesis relates the evolution of
		  plant defense to resource availability and predicts that
		  plants that have evolved in abiotically stressful
		  environments grow inherently more slowly and are more
		  constitutively resistant to herbivory than plants from more
		  productive habitats. Stress-adapted plants are also
		  predicted to have reduced inducibility, but this prediction
		  has not been previously tested. To evaluate this
		  hypothesis, I compared the growth of nine species of
		  herbaceous plants from Missouri glade habitats to congeners
		  from more productive non-glade habitats. I also conducted
		  bioassays using larvae of the generalist herbivore
		  Spodoptera exigua to estimate constitutive and inducible
		  resistance in these congeners. Glade congeners tended to
		  grow more slowly and have higher constitutive resistance
		  and lower inducibility than non-glade species. However,
		  none of these comparisons was statistically significant due
		  to the conflicting response of one congeneric pair (Salvia
		  azurea and S. lyrata). Analyses without this genus were
		  consistent with the {GR} hypothesis, as were analyses that
		  categorized congeners by relative growth rate. These
		  results highlight the complexity in searching for factors
		  that determine plant growth rates and resistance traits
		  across multiple genera and support the hypothesis that both
		  constitutive and induced resistance may be influenced by
		  selection on traits that alter plant growth rates. Future
		  studies should attempt to determine whether variation in
		  inducibility is better explained by habitat or relative
		  plant growth rates.},

		  and parasitism affect plant transcriptional and metabolic
		  responses to herbivory. We also found that hyperparasitoids
		  are able to respond to {HIPVs} released by wild B. oleracea
		  under both laboratory and field conditions. In addition, we
		  observed stronger attraction of hyperparasitoids to {HIPVs}
		  when plants were infested with parasitized caterpillars.
		  However, hyperparasitoids were equally attracted to plants
		  infested by either herbivore species. Our results indicate
		  that parasitism plays a major role in {HIPV}-mediated
		  plant–hyperparasitoid interactions. Furthermore, these
		  findings also indicate that plant trait-mediated indirect
		  interaction networks play important roles in community-wide
		  species interactions.},
