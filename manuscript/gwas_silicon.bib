	abstract = {Awns are long, stiff filamentous extensions of glumes in many grasses. In wheat, awns contribute up to 40\% of the grain's photosynthetic assimilates, and assist in seed dispersal. Awns accumulate silica in epidermal hairs and papillae, and silica has been positively associated with yield and environmental stress tolerance. Here, the awns of a set of domesticated wheat genotypes and their direct progenitor, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides were characterized. In addition, the silica concentration in awns was genetically dissected in a tetraploid wheat population of recombinant inbred lines ({RILs}) derived from a cross between durum wheat (cv. Langdon) and wild emmer (accession G18-16). Scanning electron micrographs revealed a continuous silica layer under the cuticle. Extended silicification was identified in the epidermis cell wall and in sclerenchyma cells near the vascular bundles, but not in the stomata, suggesting that an active process directs the soluble silica away from the water evaporation stream. The number of silicified cells was linearly correlated to silica concentration in dry weight ({DW}), suggesting cellular control over silicification. Domesticated wheat awns contained up to 19\% silica per {DW}, as compared with 7\% in the wild accessions, suggesting selection pressure associated with the domestication process. Six quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) for silica were identified in the awns, with a {LOD} score of 3.7–6.3, three of which overlapped genomic regions that contribute to high grain protein. Localization of silica in the awns and identification of {QTLs} help illuminate mechanisms associated with silica metabolism in wheat.},

	abstract = {The adequate presence of silicon (Si) in rice plants can enhance their yield and improve their tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study Si uptake abilities were compared between the japonica rice cultivar (cv.) Kinmaze and the indica rice cv. {DV}85 under three Si concentrations (0.16, 0.4, and 1.6mM) at different time points from 1 to 12h. The results showed that the phenotypic values of two traits—Si uptake by individual plants ({SP}, Si uptake by all roots of a plant) and Si uptake per unit root dry weight ({SR}={SP}/root dry weight)—of Kinmaze were significantly higher than those of {DV}85 (P{\textless}0.01). Meanwhile, a kinetic study indicated that the Si transporters in Kinmaze and {DV}85 had the same affinity for silicic acid, but with different Vmax values, indicating that Kinmaze had more Si transporters in the roots than {DV}85. This may be the main reason for the difference in Si uptake ability between Kinmaze and {DV}85. In addition, a mapping population consisting of 81 recombinant inbred lines ({RILs}) derived from the cross between Kinmaze and {DV}85 was used to detect quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) underlying {SP} and {SR}. The {RILs} follow a continuous one-peak distribution and show transgressive segregation in both directions for {SP}, {SR}, and root dry weight ({RDW}). Three {QTLs} for {SP}, four for {SR}, and three for {RDW} were detected. This can explain 7.16–17.15\% of the phenotypic variation ({PVE}). Thus, the results obtained in this study provide a better understanding of the mechanism of rice Si uptake ability and the basis for fine-mapping the genes involved.},

	abstract = {Quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) analysis for Si content in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was performed to study the inheritance of Si content in rice. A recombinant inbred line ({RIL}) population of 244 lines derived from the indica rice cross ‘Zhenshan 97B’ ({ZS}97B)/‘Milyang 46’ ({MY}46) were grown in 2003 with two replications. Silicon content in the hull ({HUS}), flag leaf ({FLS}), and stem ({STS}) were measured. On the basis of a linkage map consisting of 207 {DNA} marker loci, a total of 10 {QTLs} showing significant additive effects and 14 digenic interactions having significant additive-by-additive ({AA}) epistatic effects were detected. The number of {QTLs} and {AA} interactions for individual traits were four and four for {HUS}, four and four for {FLS}, and two and six for {STS}, respectively. General contributions to the phenotype variance due to additive effects and {AA} effects were 29.3 and 18.6\% for {HUS}, 14.8 and 13.6\% for {FLS}, and 8.6 and 28.6\% for {STS}, respectively. This indicates that gene actions at both the one- and two-locus levels play an important role to genetically control Si content in rice. In addition, it was shown that the detection of {QTLs} at the one-locus level, as well as magnitude and direction of the additive effect, might be influenced greatly by digenic interactions involving loci linked to the given {QTL}. By comparing these results with other reports, genetic association between {QTLs} for Si content and {QTLs} for yield component traits and lodging-tolerance related traits were evident.},

	abstract = {The 23 surface paddy soils (0–20cm) representing varying range of calcium carbonate ({CaCO}3) were collected to evaluate silicon (Si) supplying power and the factors which affect Si availability. A pot experiment and consecutive four‐year field trials were also carried out in this study to investigate the response of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Wuyujing No. 3) and wheat (Triticum aestium L. cv Yangmai No. 5) to Si‐containing materials applied to the calcareous paddy soils. The result indicated that the available Si contents (sodium acetate‐extractable {SiO}2) of the soils surveyed were much higher than the accepted critical value. Stepwise regression analysis showed that {pH} value, clay, and {CaCO}3 contents significantly affected the available Si content. The pot experiment indicated that the grain yield, spike number, and filled grain percentage and ratio of grain/shoot of the Si‐treated rice markedly increased as compared to the control, but Si added had little effect on the shoot dry matter yield and 1,000‐grain weight. On the other hand, the available and water soluble‐Si contents in the Si‐treated soils were obviously higher than those of the untreated soil both at tillering and elongation stages. The same was true for the {TCA} (Trichroloacetic acid)‐soluble Si and total Si contents in rice plants. The Si content in the percolating water also increased in the Si‐treated soils as compared with the control—especially during the first week after rice transplanting. Consecutive four‐year field trials indicated that Si applied increased the rice and wheat yields by 4.6–20.7\% and 4.1–9.3\%, respectively. The added Si‐containing materials enhanced the resistance of rice and wheat against fungal and bacterial attacks and lodging. The results obtained in this study suggest that calcareous paddy soils which have a high content of sodium acetate extractable‐Si were still Si deficient and the available‐Si extracted by this extractant might overestimate the Si‐supplying power of these calcareous soils. It will either be nessesary to develop a new extractant suitable for evaluating the available‐Si status of calcareous soils or to modify the level of available Si in these soils above which rice responses to Si fertilizer will not be obtained.},

Here, we show that terrestrial silicon cycling shifts from pedological to biological control during long-term ecosystem development along 2-million-year soil chronosequences in Western Australia. Silicon availability is determined by pedogenic silicon in young soils and recycling of plant-derived silicon in old soils as pedogenic pools become depleted. Unlike concentrations of major nutrients, which decline markedly in strongly weathered soils, foliar silicon concentrations increase continuously as soils age. Our findings show that the retention of silicon by plants during ecosystem retrogression sustains its terrestrial cycling, suggesting important plant benefits associated with this element in nutrient-poor environments.},

	abstract = {Silicon (Si) serves as bioactive beneficial element. Si is highly abundant in soil, and occurs ubiquitously in all organisms including plants and humans. During the last three decades, nutritional significance of Si for plant and human health has received increasing attention. Plant Si plays a pivotal role in growth and development, and this beneficial effect depends usually on accumulation in plant tissues, which are then protected from various forms of biotic and abiotic stresses. Likewise, human exposure to Si imparts health benefits and essentially occurs through plant-derived food products. Si bioavailability in human diet, e.g., strengthens bones and improves immune response, as well as neuronal and connective tissue health. Despite this empiric knowledge, the essentiality of Si still remains enigmatic. Thus the link between Si availability for plant development and its profound implication for human welfare should receive attention. This review aims to provide a broad perspective on Si as important element for plant and human nutrition and to define research fields for interdisciplinary research.},

We found that a rare lineage of Ae. tauschii geographically restricted to present-day Georgia contributed to the wheat D subgenome in the independent hybridizations that gave rise to modern bread wheat. Through k-mer-based association mapping, we identified discrete genomic regions with candidate genes for disease and pest resistance and demonstrated their functional transfer into wheat by transgenesis and wide crossing, including the generation of a library of hexaploids incorporating diverse Ae. tauschii genomes.

Cereals are the monocots which are known to accumulate a high amount of Si, and reaping maximum benefits associated with it. Cereals contribute a high amount of Si to the human diet compared to other food crops. In the present review, we have summarized distribution of the dietary Si in cereals and its role in the animal and human health. The Si derived benefits in cereals, specifically with respect to biotic and abiotic stress tolerance has been described. We have also discussed the molecular mechanism involved in the Si uptake in cereals, evolution of the Si transport mechanism and genetic variation in the Si concentration among different cultivars of the same species. Various genetic mutants deficient in the Si uptake have been developed and many {QTLs} governing the Si accumulation have been identified in cereals. The existing knowledge about the Si biology and available resources needs to be explored to understand and improve the Si accumulation in crop plants to achieve sustainability in agriculture.},

	abstract = {The production and quality of wheat are affected by abiotic constraints including water stress and soil nutrient deficiencies. It is imperative to develop drought-tolerant wheat varieties with high yield potential and enhanced grain protein content for food security. Silicon (Si) is important for plant growth and development but its role in abiotic stress tolerance has been overlooked in breeding programs. Identifying the underlying functional genes controlling drought tolerance, protein content and grain yield is essential for wheat improvement, especially under drought stress. Silicon uptake is conditioned by several Si transporter genes such as Lsi1, Lsi2 and Lsi6 and aquaporins, which facilitate transport of silicon and water between cells. The objectives of this review are to examine the role of Si in improving plant nutrition and drought tolerance, and to appraise the genetic control of Si uptake and breeding methods for improving Si uptake for drought adaptation and improved grain yield and quality. The review highlights the limited progress made in breeding for drought tolerance in wheat, especially in sub-Sahara Africa where the challenge is prevalent. Limited understanding of the genetic basis for Si uptake and physiology contribute to the limited progress in its exploitation in wheat improvement programs.},

	abstract = {Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome progenitor of Triticum aestivum, encompasses huge diversity for various traits of potential economic importance such as yield, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, quality and nutrition. In the present study, variation for grain size in Ae. tauschii germplasm was studied and its genetic basis dissected using genome-wide association study ({GWAS}). Grain length, width, and weight evaluated in 177 Ae. tauschii accessions over 3 years showed near normal distribution with 1.74-, 1.75-, and 2.82-fold variation, respectively. These lines were genetically characterized using genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) protocol that produced 11,489 single nucleotide polymorphic ({SNP}) markers. Genetic diversity analysis revealed the presence of two distinct subgroups (designated as lineage 1 and 2) in Ae. tauschii. Based on {GBS} markers, the genetic similarity was calculated between the accessions and {GWAS} was conducted using 114 non-redundant accessions and 5,249 {SNP} markers. A total of 17 {SNPs} associated with grain size traits distributed over all the seven chromosomes were revealed with 6D, 5D, and 2D harboring most significant marker–trait associations. Some of the chromosomal regions such as 6D\_66.4–71.1 {cM}, 1D\_143.5–156.7 {cM}, and 2D\_89.9–92.5 {cM} had associations with multiple traits.

	abstract = {Global demand for food is increasing in terms of the quantity, quality and reliability of supplies. Currently, over 90 \% of our food is grown on (or in) a virtually irreplaceable, non-renewable natural resource – the soil. This paper examines the latest research on selected soil degradation processes (soil erosion by water, compaction, loss of organic matter, loss of soil biodiversity and soil contamination) and specifically how they impact on food production. Every year, an estimated 12 million hectares of agricultural land are lost to soil degradation, adding to the billions of hectares that are already degraded. It is estimated that soil degradation leads to a potential loss of 20 million tonnes of grain per annum, but this is likely to be an underestimate, because the evidence base is limited in identifying direct impacts of soil degradation on food production. Some soil management practices have been used to mask the effects of soil degradation on food production (e.g., additions of chemical fertilisers), but comprehensive soil conservation practices are required to respond to the multiple problems of soil degradation if the world is to be able to feed more than 9 billion people by 2050.},

Further, multiple abiotic challenges due to climate change and evolving pathogen and pests pose a major concern for increasing wheat production globally. Triticeae species comprising of primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools represent a rich source of genetic diversity in wheat. The conventional breeding strategies of direct hybridization, backcrossing and selection have successfully introgressed a number of desirable traits associated with grain yield, adaptation to abiotic stresses, disease resistance, and bio-fortification of wheat varieties. However, it is time consuming to incorporate genes conferring tolerance/resistance to multiple stresses in a single wheat variety by conventional approaches due to limitations in screening methods and the lower probabilities of combining desirable alleles. Efforts on developing innovative breeding strategies, novel tools and utilizing genetic diversity for new genes/alleles are essential to improve productivity, reduce vulnerability to diseases and pests and enhance nutritional quality. New technologies of high-throughput phenotyping, genome sequencing and genomic selection are promising approaches to maximize progeny screening and selection to accelerate the genetic gains in breeding more productive varieties. Use of cisgenic techniques to transfer beneficial alleles and their combinations within related species also offer great promise especially to achieve durable rust resistance.},

	abstract = {Bread wheat (or common wheat, Triticum aestivum) is an allohexaploid ({AABBDD}, 2n = 6x = 42) that arose by hybridization between a cultivated tetraploid wheat T. turgidum ({AABB}, 2n = 4x = 28) and the wild goatgrass Aegilops tauschii ({DD}, 2n = 2x = 14). Polyploidization provided niches for rigorous genome modification at cytogenetic, genetic, and epigenetic levels, rendering a broader spread than its progenitors. This review summarizes the latest advances in understanding gene regulation mechanisms in newly synthesized allohexaploid wheat and possible correlation with polyploid growth vigor and adaptation. Cytogenetic studies reveal persistent association of whole-chromosome aneuploidy with nascent allopolyploids, in contrast to the genetic stability in common wheat. Transcriptome analysis of the euploid wheat shows that small {RNAs} are driving forces for homoeo-allele expression regulation via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The ensuing non-additively expressed genes and those with expression level dominance to the respective progenitor may play distinct functions in growth vigor and adaptation in nascent allohexaploid wheat. Further genetic diploidization of allohexaploid wheat is not random. Regional asymmetrical gene distribution, rather than subgenome dominance, is observed in both synthetic and natural allohexaploid wheats. The combinatorial effects of diverged genomes, subsequent selection of specific gene categories, and subgenome-specific traits are essential for the successful establishment of common wheat.},

	abstract = {Disease-resistance (R) gene cloning in wheat (Triticum aestivum) has been accelerated by the recent surge of genomic resources, facilitated by advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics. However, with the challenges of population growth and climate change, it is vital not only to clone and functionally characterize a few handfuls of R genes, but also to do so at a scale that would facilitate the breeding and deployment of crops that can recognize the wide range of pathogen effectors that threaten agroecosystems. Pathogen populations are continually changing, and breeders must have tools and resources available to rapidly respond to those changes if we are to safeguard our daily bread. To meet this challenge, we propose the creation of a wheat R-gene atlas by an international community of researchers and breeders. The atlas would consist of an online directory from which sources of resistance could be identified and deployed to achieve more durable resistance to the major wheat pathogens, such as wheat rusts, blotch diseases, powdery mildew, and wheat blast. We present a costed proposal detailing how the interacting molecular components governing disease resistance could be captured from both the host and the pathogen through biparental mapping, mutational genomics, and whole-genome association genetics. We explore options for the configuration and genotyping of diversity panels of hexaploid and tetraploid wheat, as well as their wild relatives and major pathogens, and discuss how the atlas could inform a dynamic, durable approach to R-gene deployment. Set against the current magnitude of wheat yield losses worldwide, recently estimated at 21\%, this endeavor presents one route for bringing R genes from the lab to the field at a considerable speed and quantity.},

	abstract = {Silicon (Si) is a metalloid which is gaining worldwide attention of plant scientists due to its ameliorating impact on plants' growth and development. The beneficial response of Si is observed predominantly under numerous abiotic and biotic stress conditions. However, under favorable conditions, most of the plant can grow without it. Therefore, Si has yet not been fully accepted as essential element rather it is being considered as quasi-essential for plants' growth. Si is also known to enhance resilience in plants by reducing the plant's stress. Besides its second most abundance on the earth crust, most of the soils lack plant available form of Si i.e. silicic acid. In this regard, understanding the role of Si in plant metabolism, its uptake from roots and transport to aerial tissues along with its ionomics and proteomics under different circumstances is of great concern. Plants have evolved a well-optimized Si-transport system including various transporter proteins like Low silicon1 (Lsi1), Low silicon2 (Lsi2), Low silicon3 (Lsi3) and Low silicon6 (Lsi6) at specific sub-cellular locations along with the expression profiling that creates precisely coordinated network among these transporters, which also facilitate uptake and accumulation of Si. Though, an ample amount of information is available pertinent to the solute specificity, active sites, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of these transporter genes. Similarly, the information regarding transporters involved in Si accumulation in different organelles is also available particularly in silica cells occurred in poales. But in this review, we have attempted to compile studies related to plants vis à vis Si, its role in abiotic and biotic stress, its uptake in various parts of plants via different types of Si-transporters, expression pattern, localization and the solute specificity. Besides these, this review will also provide the compiled knowledge about the genetic variation among crop plants vis à vis enhanced Si uptake and related benefits.},

	abstract = {Requirement of mineral elements in different plant tissues is not often consistent with their transpiration rate; therefore, plants have developed systems for preferential distribution of mineral elements to the developing tissues with low transpiration. Here we took silicon (Si) as an example and revealed an efficient system for preferential distribution of Si in the node of rice (Oryza sativa). Rice is able to accumulate more than 10\% Si of the dry weight in the husk, which is required for protecting the grains from water loss and pathogen infection. However, it has been unknown for a long time how this hyperaccumulation is achieved. We found that three transporters (Lsi2, Lsi3, and Lsi6) located at the node are involved in the intervascular transfer, which is required for the preferential distribution of Si. Lsi2 was polarly localized to the bundle sheath cell layer around the enlarged vascular bundles, which is next to the xylem transfer cell layer where Lsi6 is localized. Lsi3 was located in the parenchyma tissues between enlarged vascular bundles and diffuse vascular bundles. Similar to Lsi6, knockout of Lsi2 and Lsi3 also resulted in decreased distribution of Si to the panicles but increased Si to the flag leaf. Furthermore, we constructed a mathematical model for Si distribution and revealed that in addition to cooperation of three transporters, an apoplastic barrier localized at the bundle sheath cells and development of the enlarged vascular bundles in node are also required for the hyperaccumulation of Si in rice husk.},

	abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa) accumulates very high concentrations of silicon (Si) in the shoots, and the deposition of Si as amorphous silica helps plants to overcome biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we describe a transporter, Lsi6, which is involved in the distribution of Si in the shoots. Lsi6 belongs to the nodulin-26 intrinsic protein {III} subgroup of aquaporins and is permeable to silicic acid. Lsi6 is expressed in the leaf sheath and leaf blades as well as in the root tips. Cellular localization studies revealed that Lsi6 is found in the xylem parenchyma cells of the leaf sheath and leaf blades. Moreover, Lsi6 showed polar localization at the side facing toward the vessel. Knockdown of Lsi6 did not affect the uptake of Si by the roots but resulted in disordered deposition of silica in the shoots and increased excretion of Si in the guttation fluid. These results indicate that Lsi6 is a transporter responsible for the transport of Si out of the xylem and subsequently affects the distribution of Si in the leaf.},
