abstract = {Abstract Grasses accumulate high concentrations of silicon (Si) in their tissues, with potential benefits including herbivore defense, improved water balance, and reduced leaf construction costs. Although Si is one of the most widely varying leaf constituents among individuals, species, and ecosystems, the environmental forces driving this variation remain elusive and understudied. To understand relationships between environmental factors and grass Si accumulation better, we analyzed foliar chemistry of grasses from 17 globally distributed sites where nutrient inputs and grazing were manipulated. These sites span natural gradients in temperature, precipitation, and underlying soil properties, which allowed us to assess the relative importance of soil moisture and nutrients across variation in climate. Foliar Si concentration did not respond to large mammalian grazer exclusion, but significant variation in herbivore abundance among sites may have precluded the observation of defoliation effects at these sites. However, nutrient addition consistently reduced leaf Si, especially at sites with low soil nitrogen prior to nutrient addition. Additionally, a leaf-level trade-off between Si and carbon (C) existed that was stronger at arid sites than mesic sites. Our results suggest soil nutrient limitation favors investment in Si over C-based leaf construction, and that fixing C is especially costly relative to assimilating Si when water is limiting. Our results demonstrate the importance of soil nutrients and precipitation as key drivers of global grass silicification patterns.},

	abstract = {Silicon is not an essential element in sensu stricto but affects the productivity of Poaceae. Recent field studies has shown the effect of silicon on cellulose and lignin content in bulk analyses of green compartments of different species, sampled before matter translocation in the course of senescence. Nevertheless, there is a gap in information about silicon availability and its effect on cellulose, lignin and phenol content in different plant tissues after nutrient resorption. In order to prove the effect of controlled silica supply on functional relevant carbon compounds Phragmites australis Trin. was grown in pot trials under three different levels of silicon surplus. After resorption of nutrients into rhizomes the content of silicon, lignin, cellulose and phenol were measured in different plant tissues. The results show that different levels of silicon surplus changed the plant cellulose, lignin and phenol content depending on plant tissue function. Cellulose content in tissues with stabilization function is reduced contrasting enhanced cellulose content in tissues without stabilization function. Furthermore, higher silicon surplus decreased the phenol content in photosynthetic active tissues and increased the phenol content in culm. Only weak silicon to lignin interaction was found. It is concluded that silicon affects the cellulose and phenol metabolism and the tradeoff between productivity and stabilization/defense. Considering these compounds as crucial factors in decay processes, silicon may be very important for the terrestrial and semi-terrestrial carbon turnover},

Cluster roots function in severely P-impoverished landscapes, ‘mining’ P fixed as insoluble inorganic phosphates. The ‘scavenging’ and ‘mining’ strategies of mycorrhizal species without and non-mycorrhizal species with cluster roots, respectively, allow functioning on soils that differ markedly in P availability. Based on recent advances in our understanding of these contrasting strategies of nutrient acquisition, we provide an explanation for the distribution of mycorrhizal species on less P-impoverished soils, and for why, globally, cluster-bearing species dominate on severely P-impoverished, ancient soils, where P sensitivity is relatively common.},

	abstract = {{The City of White Rock, Canada has been facing challenges of elevated concentrations of arsenic and manganese in its drinking water supply. A pilot water treatment study was conducted to explore effective contaminant removal solutions for human health risk mitigation. The arsenic and manganese removal performance of four treatment processes, including ozonation-manganese greensand filtration ({OSF}), {OSF}-iron-based granular media adsorption ({OSFIA}), the Burgess Iron Removal Method ({BIRM}), and {BIRM}-iron-based granular media adsorption ({BIA}) were evaluated. The non-cancer health risks and the incremental lifetime cancer risks ({ILCR}) posed by arsenic in different water sources were also assessed. The results show that {OSFIA} treatment achieved the highest arsenic and manganese removal. An average arsenic removal rate of 68.5\% (initial concentration = 9.3 μg/L) was observed using {OSFIA} during two months of treatment, while manganese (initial concentration = 133.9 μg/L) can be completely removed. The arsenic removal was mainly be attributed to the adsorption of iron-based granular media. The mean values of non-cancer health risks of arsenic exposure due to oral intake of treated water were identified to be lower than the critical threshold for different age groups. In addition, the probability of critical {ILCR} occurrence can be greatly reduced. Based on the results from the pilot study, {OSFIA} was selected to construct a full-scale water treatment plant. Arsenic and manganese concentrations in the effluent from the plant can be reduced to a low-to-undetectable level, achieving negligible health risks to the residents of the city.}},

The reference-quality genome sequence Aet v4.0 for Ae. tauschii acc. {AL}8/78 was therefore an important milestone for wheat biology and breeding. Further advances in sequencing acc. {AL}8/78 and release of the Aet v5.0 sequence assembly are reported here. Two new optical maps were constructed and used in the revision of pseudomolecules. Gaps were closed with Pacific Biosciences long-read contigs, decreasing the gap number by 38,899. Transposable elements and protein-coding genes were reannotated. The number of annotated high-confidence genes was reduced from 39,635 in Aet v4.0 to 32,885 in Aet v5.0. A total of 2245 biologically important genes, including those affecting plant phenology, grain quality, and tolerance of abiotic stresses in wheat, was manually annotated and disease-resistance genes were annotated by a dedicated pipeline. Disease-resistance genes encoding nucleotide-binding site domains, receptor-like protein kinases, and receptor-like proteins were preferentially located in distal chromosome regions, whereas those encoding transmembrane coiled-coil proteins were dispersed more evenly along the chromosomes. Discovery, annotation, and expression analyses of {microRNA} ({miRNA}) precursors, mature {miRNAs}, and {phasiRNAs} are reported, including {miRNA} target genes. Other small {RNAs}, such as hc-{siRNAs} and {tRFs}, were characterized. These advances enhance the utility of the Ae. tauschii genome sequence for wheat genetics, biotechnology, and breeding.},

Chinesische Schlange) grown in nutrient solution with low to elevated Mn concentrations (0·5–1000 µm). Despite approximately the same total Mn content in the leaves, plants not treated with Si had higher Mn concentrations in the intercellular washing fluid ({IWF}) compared with plants treated with Si, especially in the {BaCl}2- and {DTPA}-exchangeable fraction of the leaf apoplast. The Mn concentration of the {IWF} correlated positively with the severity of Mn-toxicity symptoms and negatively with the Si supply. Furthermore, in Si-treated plants less Mn was located in the symplast ({\textless} 10\%) and more Mn was bound to the cell wall ({\textgreater} 90\%) compared with non-Si-treated plants (about 50\% in each compartment). Manganese present in Si-treated plants is therefore less available and for this reason less toxic than in plants not treated with Si. It is concluded that Si-mediated tolerance of Mn in C. sativus is a consequence of stronger binding of Mn to cell walls and a lowering of Mn concentration within the symplast. These results support the role of Si as an important beneficial element in plant nutrition.}},

	abstract = {Through their influence on microbial processes, carboxylates exuded by roots are key drivers of nutrient acquisition and organic carbon (C) storage in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the simultaneous interactions between environmental factors controlling the production and fates of carboxylates lead to uncertainty in understanding their role in terrestrial ecosystems. Here we suggest a more integrative view which points out that carboxylate-driven processes (metal chelation and formation of organo-mineral associations) can vary according to the soil physicochemical context. We show that variation in soil properties can substantially influence plant production of C surplus and discharge as root exudates. In addition, the control of soil processes (adsorption, complexation, leaching and biodegradation) on carboxylate fates is strongly governed by the physicochemical context. To illustrate this, the first soil scenario we present is characterized by fine-textured and nutrient-rich soils, which leads to a relatively lower root exudation rate but high potential of carboxylate associations with minerals. This soil context is more inclined to contribute to soil C storage. In the second scenario, coarse-textured and nutrient-poor soils lead to higher rates of carboxylate production and higher carboxylate ability to mobilize nutrients through chelation. In this case, the carboxylate-induced mobilization of nutrients is maximized. We wish to emphasize the need to integrate the diversity of soil properties when it comes to propose regenerative agricultural practices that capitalize on the carboxylate-driven soil processes and their related ecological functions, whose potential benefits must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the soil physicochemical context.},
