	abstract = {Silicon (Si) in plants confers a number of benefits, including resistance to herbivores and water or nutrient stress. However, the dynamics of Si during long-term ecosystem development remain poorly documented, especially the changes in soils in terms of plant availability. We studied a 2-million-year soil chronosequence to examine how long-term changes in soil properties influence soil Si pools. The chronosequence exhibits extreme mineralogical changes—from carbonate-rich to quartz-rich soils—where a carbonate weathering domain is succeeded by a silicate weathering domain. Plant-available Si concentrations were lowest in young soils (Holocene, {\textless} 6.5 ka), increased in intermediate soils (Middle Pleistocene, 120 ka), and finally decreased toward the oldest, quartz-rich soil (Early Pleistocene, 2 Ma). Silicon availability is likely low and relatively constant in the young soils because (1) carbonate weathering consumes protons and therefore reduces weathering of silicate minerals and (2) Si adsorption by secondary minerals is high in alkaline soils. In the middle-aged sites, Si availability rises with the loss of carbonates and the formation of kaolinite that appears to drive its concentration, and then falls in the oldest sites with quartz enrichment. The increasing accumulation of biogenic silica following carbonate depletion indicates stronger soil–plant Si cycling as ecosystem development proceeds. A literature analysis confirms the shift in processes controlling Si availability between the carbonate and silicate weathering domains. Overall, our results show a nonlinear response of plant-available Si to long-term pedogenesis, with likely important implications for the Si-related functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {During introduction, invasive plants can be released from specialist herbivores, but may retain generalist herbivores and encounter novel enemies. For fast-growing invasive plants, tolerance of herbivory via compensatory regrowth may be an important defense against generalist herbivory, but it is unclear whether tolerance responses are specifically induced by different herbivores and whether specificity differs among native and invasive plant populations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine the variation among native and invasive populations of Chinese tallow tree, Triadica sebifera, in their specificity of tolerance responses to herbivores by exposing plants to herbivory from either one of two generalist caterpillars occurring in the introduced range of Triadica. Simultaneously, we measured the specificity of another defensive trait, extrafloral nectar ({EFN}) production, to detect potential tradeoffs between resistance and tolerance of herbivores. Invasive populations had higher aboveground biomass tolerance than native populations, and responded non-specifically to either herbivore, while native populations had significantly different and specific aboveground biomass responses to the two herbivores. Both caterpillar species similarly induced {EFN} in native and invasive populations. Plant tolerance and {EFN} were positively correlated or had no relationship and biomass in control and herbivore-damaged plants was positively correlated, suggesting little costs of tolerance. Relationships among these vegetative traits depended on herbivore type, suggesting that some defense traits may have positive associations with growth-related processes that are differently induced by herbivores. Importantly, loss of specificity in invasive populations indicates subtle evolutionary changes in defenses in invasive plants that may relate to and enhance their invasive success.},

Increasing soil carbon sequestration is important for capturing atmospheric {CO}2 and combating climate change issues. Thus, there is an urgent need to preserve existing ecosystems and to adopt strategies such as afforestation, reforestation, and establishment of artificial grasslands to foster carbon sequestration through higher root exudate inputs in the soil.},

abstract = {Abstract Grasses accumulate high concentrations of silicon (Si) in their tissues, with potential benefits including herbivore defense, improved water balance, and reduced leaf construction costs. Although Si is one of the most widely varying leaf constituents among individuals, species, and ecosystems, the environmental forces driving this variation remain elusive and understudied. To understand relationships between environmental factors and grass Si accumulation better, we analyzed foliar chemistry of grasses from 17 globally distributed sites where nutrient inputs and grazing were manipulated. These sites span natural gradients in temperature, precipitation, and underlying soil properties, which allowed us to assess the relative importance of soil moisture and nutrients across variation in climate. Foliar Si concentration did not respond to large mammalian grazer exclusion, but significant variation in herbivore abundance among sites may have precluded the observation of defoliation effects at these sites. However, nutrient addition consistently reduced leaf Si, especially at sites with low soil nitrogen prior to nutrient addition. Additionally, a leaf-level trade-off between Si and carbon (C) existed that was stronger at arid sites than mesic sites. Our results suggest soil nutrient limitation favors investment in Si over C-based leaf construction, and that fixing C is especially costly relative to assimilating Si when water is limiting. Our results demonstrate the importance of soil nutrients and precipitation as key drivers of global grass silicification patterns.},

	abstract = {Silicon is not an essential element in sensu stricto but affects the productivity of Poaceae. Recent field studies has shown the effect of silicon on cellulose and lignin content in bulk analyses of green compartments of different species, sampled before matter translocation in the course of senescence. Nevertheless, there is a gap in information about silicon availability and its effect on cellulose, lignin and phenol content in different plant tissues after nutrient resorption. In order to prove the effect of controlled silica supply on functional relevant carbon compounds Phragmites australis Trin. was grown in pot trials under three different levels of silicon surplus. After resorption of nutrients into rhizomes the content of silicon, lignin, cellulose and phenol were measured in different plant tissues. The results show that different levels of silicon surplus changed the plant cellulose, lignin and phenol content depending on plant tissue function. Cellulose content in tissues with stabilization function is reduced contrasting enhanced cellulose content in tissues without stabilization function. Furthermore, higher silicon surplus decreased the phenol content in photosynthetic active tissues and increased the phenol content in culm. Only weak silicon to lignin interaction was found. It is concluded that silicon affects the cellulose and phenol metabolism and the tradeoff between productivity and stabilization/defense. Considering these compounds as crucial factors in decay processes, silicon may be very important for the terrestrial and semi-terrestrial carbon turnover},

Plant traits that are regarded as adaptations to N- and P-limited conditions include mycorrhizas and cluster roots. Mycorrhizas ‘scavenge’ P from solution or ‘mine’ insoluble organic N. Cluster roots function in severely P-impoverished landscapes, ‘mining’ P fixed as insoluble inorganic phosphates. The ‘scavenging’ and ‘mining’ strategies of mycorrhizal species without and non-mycorrhizal species with cluster roots, respectively, allow functioning on soils that differ markedly in P availability. Based on recent advances in our understanding of these contrasting strategies of nutrient acquisition, we provide an explanation for the distribution of mycorrhizal species on less P-impoverished soils, and for why, globally, cluster-bearing species dominate on severely P-impoverished, ancient soils, where P sensitivity is relatively common.},

	abstract = {{The City of White Rock, Canada has been facing challenges of elevated concentrations of arsenic and manganese in its drinking water supply. A pilot water treatment study was conducted to explore effective contaminant removal solutions for human health risk mitigation. The arsenic and manganese removal performance of four treatment processes, including ozonation-manganese greensand filtration ({OSF}), {OSF}-iron-based granular media adsorption ({OSFIA}), the Burgess Iron Removal Method ({BIRM}), and {BIRM}-iron-based granular media adsorption ({BIA}) were evaluated. The non-cancer health risks and the incremental lifetime cancer risks ({ILCR}) posed by arsenic in different water sources were also assessed. The results show that {OSFIA} treatment achieved the highest arsenic and manganese removal. An average arsenic removal rate of 68.5\% (initial concentration = 9.3 μg/L) was observed using {OSFIA} during two months of treatment, while manganese (initial concentration = 133.9 μg/L) can be completely removed. The arsenic removal was mainly be attributed to the adsorption of iron-based granular media. The mean values of non-cancer health risks of arsenic exposure due to oral intake of treated water were identified to be lower than the critical threshold for different age groups. In addition, the probability of critical {ILCR} occurrence can be greatly reduced. Based on the results from the pilot study, {OSFIA} was selected to construct a full-scale water treatment plant. Arsenic and manganese concentrations in the effluent from the plant can be reduced to a low-to-undetectable level, achieving negligible health risks to the residents of the city.}},

Further advances in sequencing acc. {AL}8/78 and release of the Aet v5.0 sequence assembly are reported here. Two new optical maps were constructed and used in the revision of pseudomolecules. Gaps were closed with Pacific Biosciences long-read contigs, decreasing the gap number by 38,899. Transposable elements and protein-coding genes were reannotated. The number of annotated high-confidence genes was reduced from 39,635 in Aet v4.0 to 32,885 in Aet v5.0. A total of 2245 biologically important genes, including those affecting plant phenology, grain quality, and tolerance of abiotic stresses in wheat, was manually annotated and disease-resistance genes were annotated by a dedicated pipeline. Disease-resistance genes encoding nucleotide-binding site domains, receptor-like protein kinases, and receptor-like proteins were preferentially located in distal chromosome regions, whereas those encoding transmembrane coiled-coil proteins were dispersed more evenly along the chromosomes. Discovery, annotation, and expression analyses of {microRNA} ({miRNA}) precursors, mature {miRNAs}, and {phasiRNAs} are reported, including {miRNA} target genes. Other small {RNAs}, such as hc-{siRNAs} and {tRFs}, were characterized. These advances enhance the utility of the Ae. tauschii genome sequence for wheat genetics, biotechnology, and breeding.},

Despite approximately the same total Mn content in the leaves, plants not treated with Si had higher Mn concentrations in the intercellular washing fluid ({IWF}) compared with plants treated with Si, especially in the {BaCl}2- and {DTPA}-exchangeable fraction of the leaf apoplast. The Mn concentration of the {IWF} correlated positively with the severity of Mn-toxicity symptoms and negatively with the Si supply. Furthermore, in Si-treated plants less Mn was located in the symplast ({\textless} 10\%) and more Mn was bound to the cell wall ({\textgreater} 90\%) compared with non-Si-treated plants (about 50\% in each compartment). Manganese present in Si-treated plants is therefore less available and for this reason less toxic than in plants not treated with Si. It is concluded that Si-mediated tolerance of Mn in C. sativus is a consequence of stronger binding of Mn to cell walls and a lowering of Mn concentration within the symplast. These results support the role of Si as an important beneficial element in plant nutrition.}},

	abstract = {Through their influence on microbial processes, carboxylates exuded by roots are key drivers of nutrient acquisition and organic carbon (C) storage in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the simultaneous interactions between environmental factors controlling the production and fates of carboxylates lead to uncertainty in understanding their role in terrestrial ecosystems. Here we suggest a more integrative view which points out that carboxylate-driven processes (metal chelation and formation of organo-mineral associations) can vary according to the soil physicochemical context. We show that variation in soil properties can substantially influence plant production of C surplus and discharge as root exudates. In addition, the control of soil processes (adsorption, complexation, leaching and biodegradation) on carboxylate fates is strongly governed by the physicochemical context. To illustrate this, the first soil scenario we present is characterized by fine-textured and nutrient-rich soils, which leads to a relatively lower root exudation rate but high potential of carboxylate associations with minerals. This soil context is more inclined to contribute to soil C storage. In the second scenario, coarse-textured and nutrient-poor soils lead to higher rates of carboxylate production and higher carboxylate ability to mobilize nutrients through chelation. In this case, the carboxylate-induced mobilization of nutrients is maximized. We wish to emphasize the need to integrate the diversity of soil properties when it comes to propose regenerative agricultural practices that capitalize on the carboxylate-driven soil processes and their related ecological functions, whose potential benefits must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the soil physicochemical context.},

	abstract = {Plants are often sequentially attacked by multiple herbivores; feeding by one herbivore can alter host plant quality that affects the performance of subsequent herbivores. Previous studies suggest that silicon (Si) is a highly inducible defence in grasses (Poaceae) following herbivory, so could mediate such temporally separated insect herbivore interactions. Elevated atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations ({eCO}2), in contrast, often reduce Si accumulation, which potentially weakens this interaction. We examined the effects of prior feeding by Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on the performance of crickets, Acheta domesticus (L.) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), subsequently feeding on the same plant. We used Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. grass supplemented or non-supplemented with Si and grown in the glasshouse maintained at ambient ({aCO}2) or {eCO}2 concentrations. As hypothesized, prior feeding by caterpillars induced Si accumulation. Despite {eCO}2 reducing Si accumulation, initial herbivore induction of Si negated the effects of {eCO}2. Both, previous caterpillar herbivory and Si supplementation reduced cricket performance. Si induction by successive herbivory was additive. Plant biomass was similar in plants attacked by caterpillars alone or both herbivores, suggesting that initial Si induction by caterpillars deterred feeding by crickets. Our results demonstrate that Si induction by one herbivore negatively impacts successive herbivores, as has been demonstrated for secondary metabolite-mediated interactions. Uniquely, however, Si induction is an irreversible defence and potentially a stronger, or perhaps longer-lasting mediator of such herbivore interactions in some plant taxa.},

Environmental change, such as increasing atmospheric concentrations of {CO}2, may alter allocation to Si defences in grasses, potentially changing the feeding behaviour and performance of herbivores, which may in turn impact on higher trophic groups. Using Si-treated and untreated grasses (Phalaris aquatica) maintained under ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (640 and 800 ppm) {CO}2 concentrations, we show that Si reduced feeding by crickets (Acheta domesticus), resulting in smaller body mass. This, in turn, reduced predatory behaviour by praying mantids (Tenodera sinensis), which consequently performed worse. Despite elevated {CO}2 decreasing Si concentrations in P. aquatica, this reduction was not large enough to affect the feeding behaviour of crickets or their predator. Our results suggest that Si-based defences in plants have adverse impacts on both primary and secondary trophic taxa, and these are not likely to decline under future climate change scenarios.},

The presence of symbionts in host plants can be an important factor influencing the outcome of plant–insect interactions. Similarly, herbivore identity can alter the outcome of plant–symbiont interactions. Symbiotic foliar fungal endophytes confer resistance to herbivores in economically important agronomic grasses, in part through the production of alkaloids. Although endophytes are common in nature, relatively little is known about their effects on herbivores of native, wild grass species, and a recent meta-analysis suggested that endophytes are only beneficial in agronomic settings. In this study, we performed choice trials for five insect species and a greenhouse experiment with one species to assess effects of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium sp. on herbivores of the wild grass Festuca subverticillata. In feeding trials, endophyte presence altered the preference of all five insect species tested. However, the magnitude and direction of preference varied among species, with Pterophylla camellifolia (F.), Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), and Rhopalosiphum padi L. preferring endophyte-disinfected plants and Encoptolophus costalis (Scudder) and Romalea guttata (Houttuyn) preferring endophyte-symbiotic plants. Despite reducing insect preference, the endophyte had no significant effect on S. frugiperda performance in a no-choice greenhouse experiment and did not increase plant growth in response to this herbivore. Our results show that endophyte-mediated resistance to herbivory depends strongly on herbivore identity and suggest that the fitness consequences of endophyte symbiosis for host plants will be context dependent on the local composition of insect herbivores.},

One potential source of variation in herbivore impacts results from differing feeding modes of herbivores. We examined the relative importance of inflorescence-feeding insects versus large ungulates in affecting the fecundity of Balsamorhiza sagittata (Asteraceae), a dominant native perennial forb in western Montana, {USA}. We quantified these effects across four sites that varied in elevation to determine how consistent herbivore impacts were across these divergent sites. Insect herbivores were present in flower heads at all sites but they significantly depressed plant fecundity at two of the four sites. At the two sites where herbivore suppression had significant effects, this treatment let to 1.6 and 3.4-fold increases in seed production, respectively. In contrast, across all sites ungulates had minimal impacts on balsamroot flower and seed production. Seed addition experiments revealed that at some sites and in some years B. sagittata is seed-limited, as there was a positive relationship between seed input and seedling recruitment. Thus, reductions in seed production from heavy insect herbivory may limit balsamroot recruitment in some locations. Overall, results show that inconspicuous insects have stronger effects on balsamroot fecundity than do mammalian herbivores, but the magnitude of negative impacts at both the individual and population-level vary by site.},

Silicon uptake mechanisms can be both passive and active, with the latter suggesting that there is an energetic cost to silicon uptake. This study assessed the effects of plant-available soil silicon and herbivory on the competitive interactions between the grasses Poa annua, a species that has previously been reported to accumulate only small amounts of silicon, and Lolium perenne, a high silicon accumulator.Plants were grown in mono- and mixed cultures under greenhouse conditions. Plant-available soil silicon levels were manipulated by adding silicon to the soil in the form of sodium silicate. Subsets of mixed culture pots were exposed to above-ground herbivory by desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria).In the absence of herbivory, silicon addition increased biomass of P. annua but decreased biomass of L. perenne. Silicon addition increased foliar silicon concentrations of both grass species \&gt;4-fold. Under low soil-silicon availability the herbivores removed more leaf biomass from L. perenne than from P. annua, whereas under high silicon availability the reverse was true. Consequently, herbivory shifted the competitive balance between the two grass species, with the outcome depending on the availability of soil silicon.It is concluded that a complex interplay between herbivore abundance, growth–defence trade-offs and the availability of soil silicon in the grasses' local environment affects the outcome of inter-specific competition, and so has the potential to impact on plant community structure.},

Here, we characterized the large family of {CASP}-like ({CASPL}) proteins. {CASPLs} were found in all major divisions of land plants as well as in green algae; homologs outside of the plant kingdom were identified as members of the {MARVEL} protein family. When ectopically expressed in the endodermis, most {CASPLs} were able to integrate the {CASP} membrane domain, which suggests that {CASPLs} share with {CASPs} the propensity to form transmembrane scaffolds. Extracellular loops are not necessary for generating the scaffold, since {CASP}1 was still able to localize correctly when either one of the extracellular loops was deleted. The {CASP} first extracellular loop was found conserved in euphyllophytes but absent in plants lacking Casparian strips, an observation that may contribute to the study of Casparian strip and root evolution.
