abstract  ="Folin–Ciocalteu and the more recent Fast Blue BB (FBBB) reactions are used for the quantification of total phenolics in food matrices. Despite its known interferences{,} Folin–Ciocalteu is still widely employed{,} considering Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) as clean-up step only in a few cases. Meanwhile{,} FBBB has shown no interferences for the determination of total phenolics in fruits and cereals{,} although its utilization in other popular matrices containing potential interferences{,} such as legumes{,} remains unexplored. In this study{,} the total phenolic content of 24 flours from legumes{,} cereals{,} fruits{,} nuts and plant seeds was evaluated by Folin–Ciocalteu and FBBB{,} with and without SPE. Folin–Ciocalteu showed interferences for 75\% of the flours (attributed to reducing sugars and enediols){,} whereas FBBB only for legumes and nuts (attributed to the presence of tyrosine){,} both methods in those matrices requiring SPE. Although both SPE-FBBB and SPE-Folin–Ciocalteu presented excellent reproducibility{,} SPE-FBBB displayed 1.5 times higher sensitivity."
